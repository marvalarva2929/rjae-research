{"question": "Title: Adele Background: Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans. Evans left when Adele was two, leaving her mother to raise her. She began singing at age four and asserts that she became obsessed with voices. Growing up, Adele spent most of her time singing rather than reading; the last book she read was Roald Dahl's Matilda when she was six years old. Section: Voice Passage: Adele is a mezzo-soprano with a range spanning from C3 to B5. However Classic FM state she is often mistaken for a contralto due to the application of a tense chest mix to achieve her lower notes, whilst also noting that her voice becomes its clearest as she ascends the register, particularly from C4 to C5. Rolling Stone reported that following throat surgery her voice had become \"palpably bigger and purer-toned\", and that she had added a further four notes to the top of her range. Initially, critics suggested that her vocals were more developed and intriguing than her songwriting, a sentiment with which Adele agreed. She has stated: \"I taught myself how to sing by listening to Ella Fitzgerald for acrobatics and scales, Etta James for passion and Roberta Flack for control.\"  Her voice has received acclaim from critics. In a review of 19, The Observer said, \"The way she stretched the vowels, her wonderful soulful phrasing, the sheer unadulterated pleasure of her voice, stood out all the more; little doubt that she's a rare singer\". BBC Music wrote, \"Her melodies exude warmth, her singing is occasionally stunning and, ...she has tracks that make Lily Allen and Kate Nash sound every bit as ordinary as they are.\"  For their reviews of 21, The New York Times' chief music critic Jon Pareles commended Adele's emotive timbre, comparing her to Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark, and Annie Lennox: \"[Adele] can seethe, sob, rasp, swoop, lilt and belt, in ways that draw more attention to the song than to the singer\". Ryan Reed of Paste magazine regarded her voice as \"a raspy, aged-beyond-its-years thing of full-blooded beauty\", while MSN Music's Tom Townshend declared her \"the finest singer of [our] generation\". CANNOTANSWER  Question: What is Adele's voice like? Answer: Adele is a mezzo-soprano with a range spanning from C3 to B5. Question: How did she train her voice?

{"question": "The town of Springhill frequently must declare a water emergency, making it temporarily unlawful to use water for such nonessential purposes as car washing.

{"question": "Title: Sevendust Background: Sevendust is an American alternative metal band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 1994 by bassist Vince Hornsby, drummer Morgan Rose and guitarist John Connolly. After their first demo, lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and guitarist Clint Lowery joined the group. Following a few name changes, the members settled on the name Sevendust and released their self-titled debut album on April 15, 1997. They have attained success with three consecutive RIAA gold certified albums, a Grammy nomination, and have sold millions of albums worldwide. Section: Early years and Sevendust (1994-1998) Passage: In 1994, bassist Vince Hornsby joined drummer Morgan Rose in a band called Snake Nation. John Connolly, a drummer, left his then band and joined Snake Nation as a guitarist. They recorded their first demo. Not happy with vocals, however, Snake Nation spent a year searching for a new singer before finding Lajon Witherspoon. Six months passed, Clint Lowery joined the band, and they renamed themselves Rumblefish.  Rumblefish was short-lived, however, because they found another band with the same name. They renamed themselves Crawlspace, and released \"My Ruin\" on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack album entitled More Kombat through TVT Records in 1996. Shortly after, another band named Crawlspac' sent notice that they wanted $2,500 for the rights to their name. Rather than purchase the rights, the band members chose to rename themselves Sevendust, a name inspired by the commercial insecticide brand \"Sevin Dust\". The song Rumble Fish was included on the band's second album, Home.  Sevendust released their self-titled debut, in-part produced by former Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French, on April 15, 1997, known for its heavy riffs, angry vocals and thrash-like drumming, as in the songs \"Black\" and \"Bitch\". \"Black\" became the opening song for nearly every Sevendust concert until 2004. The debut album also contains the song \"My Ruin\", from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack. Sevendust appeared on the Billboard 200, remained there for sixteen weeks and peaked at 165 on April 4, 1998. The album went gold on May 19, 1999.  In 1998, Sevendust performed at Dynamo Open Air (May 29-31) and Ozzfest 1998 (July through August). In the same year they released a compilation called Live and Loud which featured live footage of the band's performance of September 16, 1998 at Chicago's Metro.

He is well known for his electronic music, veganism and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him \"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\". Section: 2013-2015: Innocents Passage: Between February and August 2013, Moby performed both acoustic and DJ sets at the Wanderlust Festival, which hosted events in Hawaii, Vermont, California and Colorado in the United States, and also in Canada and Chile internationally. He added a single Asia performance date at the 1 World Music Festival in Singapore. Moby also performed two 75-minute DJ sets at the Coachella festival in April which featured a unique visual collaboration with NASA, with various images from space projected onto screens during the performance. Moby followed-up with another DJ set at the Movement Detroit festival in May.  For Record Store Day 2013, Moby released a 7-inch record called The Lonely Night which featured former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan. An accompanying video was created by Colin Rich, of which Moby stated: \"I'm really excited to have an experimental music video from this great video artist, and I feel like the slow, rich, and languorous desert visuals fit the song perfectly.\" The track was subsequently released as a download with remixes by Photek, Gregor Tresher, Freescha and Moby himself.  In July, Moby announced that he would be releasing a new studio album entitled Innocents. The album had been written and recorded in the previous 18 months and was due for release in October. The album was recorded in Moby's apartment and features a number of guest vocalists, in keeping with earlier releases such as Play, 18 and Wait For Me. As with Destroyed, the photographs comprising the album's artwork were all shot by Moby.

Moby stated that the reason for doing little to no touring for this album was that \"when I go on tour I sit around a lot (cars, airports, hotels, etc), and when I sit around I can't spend my time making music. And pretty much all I want to do in life is stay home and make music. So, thus: a 3 date world tour.\"  He conceded that he might return to world touring in the future.

Trimming the active component of the Army from 580,000 to 450,000 would hardly take us back to the interwar Army of 280,000 that gave birth to great wartime leaders like Dwight Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, George A. Patton or Douglass MacArthur, but it still represents a significant reduction in manpower. It undoubtedly will start World War III on the Hill and among other elements of what Ike referred to as our \"military-industrial complex,\" but Hagel should hold the line as the time is ripe for an audacious move on this front. He should stand by these cuts for three reasons:Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced significant cuts to the U.S. ArmyMichael Desch: Defense Department, military can't be exempt from budget cutsDesch: Personnel costs are huge; Army has most members so will bear the bruntHe says drone attacks, special op warfare are the future, not \"boots on the ground\"   Questions:While modern weapons systems have astronomical price tags, the dirty secret is that one of the biggest lines in the Pentagon's budget is personnel costs -- primarily salaries and health care -- that constitute 26% of the _'s 2014 request of $527 billion.

{"question": "Title: James Fenimore Cooper Background: James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 - September 14, 1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the first half of the 19th century. His historical romances draw a picture of frontier and American Indian life in the early American days which created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William on property that he owned. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and contributed generously to it. Section: Early life and family Passage: James Fenimore Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, most of whom died during infancy or childhood. He was descended from James Cooper of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, who immigrated to the American colonies in 1679.  Shortly after James' first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York that had previously been occupied by the Iroquois, who had allied themselves with the British during the Revolutionary War and were forced to cede the territory after British defeat. The State of New York opened the land for sale and development after the war, and Cooper's father purchased several thousand acres in upstate along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River. By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. He soon began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten.  Cooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student's door -- after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room. He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17. By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him on an officer's warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson.  At 20, Cooper inherited a fortune from his father. He married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811 at age 21. She was from a wealthy family who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. She and her father often edited each other's work. Among his descendants was Paul Fenimore Cooper (1899-1970), who also became a writer.

{"question": "Title: Moby Background: Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965), better known by his stage name Moby, is an American musician, DJ, record producer, singer, songwriter, photographer and animal rights activist. He is well known for his electronic music, veganism and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him \"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\". Section: 2010-2012: Destroyed Passage: In January 2010, Moby announced that he was to begin working on his next record. He said \"the mood for this record will be more acoustic and less electronic than before\". Around this time Moby started a heavy metal band with his friend Phil Costello, Diamondsnake, getting back to his roots. Diamondsnake released two albums on Facebook.  On February 15, 2011, Moby announced the release of his new album, Destroyed. It was released on May 16, 2011. A photography book with the same name was also released around the time of the album.  \"Musically\", he said, \"it's very melodic and atmospheric and electronic, and if i had to sum it up i would describe it as: 'broken down melodic electronic music for empty cities at 2 a.m'.\" The album cover, which was released with the new information, was taken in LaGuardia Airport. It is a picture of a sign that reads 'destroyed', part of the longer phrase \"All unclaimed baggage will be destroyed.\" The album consists of 15 tracks, one of them previously featured on the compilation A Night in NYC, titled \"Rockets\". Along with the album's announcement came the release of the EP Be the One, which contains 3 of the tracks from Destroyed The EP was released free for those who signed up for Moby's mailing list. For the next single, Moby put a poll on his website for fans to choose which single should be released next, and it came to be \"Lie Down in Darkness\".  On August 30, Moby posted another request for the third official single, this time asking fans to say which should be next, without a poll. After this, he announced the following day through his Twitter that the next singles are \"After\" and \"The Right Thing\".  On April 30, 2012, Moby released Destroyed Remixed, a limited edition 2CD collection of remixes of songs from the 2011 studio album, Destroyed. The release included three new exclusive remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost!, and System Divine, and also featured a brand new 30 minute ambient track by Moby called 'All Sides Gone'.

{"question": "Title: Mary Decker Background: Mary Teresa Slaney (formerly Tabb, nee Decker; born August 4, 1958) is a retired American middle-distance runner. During her career, she won gold medals in the 1500 meters and 3000 meters at the 1983 World Championships, and was the world record holder in the mile, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters. In total, she set 17 official and unofficial world records, including being the first woman in history to break 4:20 for the mile. She also set 36 US national records at distances ranging from 800 meters to 10,000 meters, and has held the US record in the mile, 2000 meters and 3000 meters since the early 1980s, while her 1500 meters record stood for 32 years. Section: The 1984 Olympic incident Passage: Decker was heavily favored to win a gold medal in the 3000 meters run at the 1984 Summer Olympics, held at Los Angeles. In the final, Zola Budd, representing Great Britain, had been running barefoot side by side with Decker for three laps and moved ahead. In an attempt to put pressure on Budd, Decker remained close by in a crowded space. Decker stood on Budd, then shortly after, collided with the barefoot runner and fell spectacularly to the curb. As a result, Mary Decker did not finish the race, which was won by Maricica Puica of Romania (Budd finished seventh). Decker was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. At a press conference she said that Budd was to blame for the collision. While it is generally the trailing athlete's responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead, it is also an accepted convention among most distance runners that the leader be a full stride ahead before cutting in. Track officials initially disqualified Budd for obstruction, but she was reinstated just one hour later once officials had viewed films of the race. Despite being behind Budd, Decker's claim that Budd had bumped into her leg was supported by a number of U.S. sports journalists, and Budd was hounded constantly in the press as a result, receiving a number of death threats. The claim was never accepted by the director of the games or the IAAF.  Decker and Budd next met in July 1985, in a 3000 meters race at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London, England. Decker won the race, and Budd finished in fourth place. After the race, the two women shook hands and made up. Decker later went on record as claiming that she was unfairly robbed of the LA 3000 meters gold medal by Budd, but said many years after the event \"The reason I fell, some people think she tripped me deliberately. I happen to know that wasn't the case at all. The reason I fell is because I am and was very inexperienced in running in a pack.\"  Decker had a successful 1985 season, winning twelve mile and 3000 meters races in the European athletics calendar, which included a new official world record for the women's mile of 4:16.71 in Zurich (Natalya Artyomova's 4:15.8 in 1984, not being ratified by the IAAF). Since that race in 1985, her time has only been bettered on four occasions. That race in Zurich also matched her with both of the other principle athletes from the Olympic race, Slaney vanquishing both Puica and Budd who themselves ran times that until July 9, 2017 also ranked in the top 10 of all time.  She sat out the 1986 season to give birth to her only child, daughter Ashley Lynn (born May 30, 1986), but missed the 1987 season due to injury. She qualified for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, but failed to win a medal. She did not qualify for the 1992 Games. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was the 1984 olympic incident?

{"question": "In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.   I have never had a facial before. For me, it sounds like something a woman might do. It had never even occurred to me that a man, a black African man, might one day go for a facial. Mere talk of pre-wash facial scrubs makes my hair stand on end. Well, a lot has changed. Because this boy from Soweto has just dived head-first into male grooming. I felt like a goat going for a traditional slaughter when I walked into Sorbet Men's Grooming salon in the upmarket Sandton district of Johannesburg - nervous, disoriented, even hopeful of a reprieve. The salon's staff are dressed in trendy black uniforms. R&B music booms from speakers in the ceiling. \"Hi Milton, welcome to your 1.30pm appointment,\" says the glamorous young receptionist. I try to put on a confident smile and she ushers me to Lelanie deJager, my groomer. A blonde, charming lady, she directs me to a swivelling leather chair in front of a spotless mirror. Lelanie has 18 years' experience in men's grooming, having begun her training in Ireland. As she prepares me for the initial scrub, she tells me that she loves male grooming and could never work with women. I smile, still not sure about this. I ask her whether African men are taking to grooming. \"Like a duck to water,\" she says. According to Siphiwe Mpye, a trends consultant based in Braamfontein, a hipster enclave of Johannesburg, the culture of skin-care has been growing rapidly across Africa, with South Africa leading the way. As a former editor of South Africa's GQ men's magazine, he knows what he is talking about. Looking the part himself, he tells me that growth in the beauty and grooming industry is being driven by black African men buying products. But what is driving that, I ask. It is partly because of global trends, he says, but also because sustained economic growth in Africa has been giving men greater disposable income. So what happened to the traditional Zulu man with a six-pack who prepared to go out by taking a cold shower? Well, that Zulu man is today's customer for grooming products, says Mr Mpye. \"The continent has changed, the continent continues to change as the world changes, and as the world changes, Africa is being touted as the future,\" he says. \"I suppose in a lot of ways we are embracing the future right now.\" Gone are the days when it was only women who spent time in front of the mirror. Today, women are looking for partners who are also well-polished and manicured. And the men have got that message. Businesswoman Tsakani Mashaba, founder of Michael Makiala for Men, says there was a gap in the market for products that catered to the specific needs of black male skin. Research suggests that black men are more prone to razor bumps because their curly beards are more susceptible to ingrown hairs, she says. She explains that her products soften the hair so that it continues to grow away from the face. The marketing graduate researched and worked with a biochemist to manufacture the country's first locally produced skin-care range for black men. \"African men suffered a lot from razor bumps, oily skin and pigmentation. There wasn't a brand out there in the market that catered for that. \"So I went on a journey to formulate a product for you guys and here we are,\" she tells me, beaming. When I grew up, it was much simpler. The local barber would splash on methylated spirit to control razor bumps after a man had had his head shaved clean. Back in the present, Lelanie has wrapped me in a hot towel for a light steam treatment to open my pores. After that, she applies a lotion to soften this old township face. Then comes the razor - a brand new cut-throat blade, like the one used in that memorable scene from the James Bond film, Skyfall. It is my first time with such a thing. Very gently, Lelanie starts shaving me. When she has finished, it is time for another hot towel and then moisturiser. I feel almost as if my skin is breathing. I feel new. I feel like a million dollars! But that township-man feeling has never left me. I still feel like an African man.", "answer": "The male grooming and beauty industry is booming in South Africa, with products now targeting a new audience - black men, as the BBC's Milton Nkosi finds out."}

Under 100 words is a good title length.   Background: Data for predicting which patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection are likely to run a complicated course are sparse. We retrospectively studied whether the admission serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can serve as a predictor of illness severity. Methods: Included were all consecutive adult patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between May-December, 2009 with a flu-like illness, a confirmed diagnosis of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection and a serum CRP level measured within 24 hours of presentation. Patients with a proven additional concurrent acute illness (e.g., bacteremia) were excluded. We used the ROC curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the predictive ability of CRP as a prognostic factor. Results: Seventeen (9%) of the 191 enrolled patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom eight (4%) required mechanical ventilation and three (2%) died. The median admission serum CRP levels were significantly higher among patients who required subsequent ICU care and mechanical ventilation than among patients who did not (123 mg/L and 112 mg/L vs. 40 mg/L, p < .001 and 43 mg/L, p = .017, respectively). A Cox proportional hazard model identified admission serum CRP levels and auscultatory findings over the lungs as independent prognostic factors for ICU admission. Admission serum CRP levels were the only independent prognostic factor for mechanical ventilation. Thirty days after presenting to the ED, none of the patients with admission serum CRP level <28 mg/L (lower tertile) required either ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. At the same time point, 19% of the patients with admission serum CRP level ≥70 mg/L (upper tertile) needed to be admitted to the ICU and 8% of the same upper tertile group required mechanical ventilation. The differences in the rates between the lower vs. upper tertile groups were significant (Log-Rank p < .001 for ICU and p < .024 for mechanical ventilation). Conclusions: In our study group, serum CRP levels obtained in the early ED admission stage from patients presenting with pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection were found to serve as a useful gauge for predicting disease course and assisting in patient management.", "answer": "C-reactive protein serum levels as an early predictor of outcome in patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus infection"}

Question: Which team had more wins, the Reds or the Pirates? Passage 1:The New York Giants season was the franchise's 49th season in the National Football League. The season saw the Giants attempting to improve on their 8–6 record from 1972. However, the Giants suffered one of the worst seasons in franchise history, winning only two games, while losing eleven, and tying one. The two wins were against the Houston Oilers and the St. Louis Cardinals while the tie was against archrival Philadelphia, in what turned out to be the last game the Giants would ever play at Yankee Stadium before playing their final five home games at the Yale Bowl in Connecticut. They moved to Shea Stadium in 1975 and to Giants Stadium in 1976. The two wins by the Giants equalled the second fewest the team had ever posted in any season and it was their worst season since a 1–12–1 record in 1966. After the season, head coach Alex Webster was fired and replaced the following season by Bill Arnsparger.   Passage 2:While visiting his parents for Christmas at Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1975, Atkinson found a job as a newspaper reporter for The Morning Sun in Pittsburg, Kansas, covering crime, local government, and other topics in southeast Kansas, an area known as “the Little Balkans” for its ethnic diversity and fractious politics.

About two months ago I got the implant birth control for my best friend then boyfriend. We ended up breaking up but remained close friends. Now I've always been your stereotypical PMS bitch but the hormonal implant made that get cranked up from a four to an eleven. Rather than just having a few days a month of pure ultra sensitive insanity, I was having on and off again day or two long months of being just ultra sensitive on top of mood swings and extreme cravings that I couldn't fight that BF would chastise me for. I would feel extreme guilt over the binge eating which made me extremely depressed almost to the point of being suicidal.  I recognize that I get mad over little things and blow up over something that is nothing but it's extremely difficult for me to control hormonal emotional issues like these unless someone is literally telling me \"hey you're PMSing you should take a breather\". Normally not that big of a deal when it's one or two days out of a month but now it was happening two to three days at a time every week and a half.  I'm not justifying my extremely bad outbursts. They're extremely bad and I recognize this. I've been getting better about it since my body has been adjusting to the hormonal birth control. It's been trying to get back into therapy, too, to help manage my emotions and be more understanding of others.  This particular issue, though. My bestfriend decided that he had finally had enough. He drank a soda I wanted to try with him, without me and for some reason this was The Worst Thing He Could Do and I completely had a meltdown over this and blew up at him. I've told him I can be very irrational when I'm PMSing. I felt it coming on and tried to be rational. I told him once that I was upset with him. He ignored it. Told him a second time. He ignored it again. Now I'm fully enraged and going on about how he's selfish and doesn't care about me. I later apologized for once I calmed down and realized how ridiculous I was being. By that point he had blocked me on snapchat, Instagram, discord, steam, and Skype. He texted me saying that he didn't hate me but the blow ups get old and he was sick of the immaturity and that he was trying to get rid of toxic people in his life and that I needed to go and I needed to grow and mature and be happy without him. He then blocked my number and completely cut off contact. He did it all through text and wouldn't talk to me on the phone about it. It hurts to lose a bestfriend of well over a year like this...  ...Am I the asshole here?

The transfer of power was made September 19, 1760 in Otumba, and his formal entry into Mexico City was October 6, 1760. Among his immediate and most important concerns was the organization of a true colonial army. As he passed through Puebla he reviewed a battalion of militia formed of Negroes and Mulattoes. Their arms were very irregular, and the new viceroy made a formal request to Spain for new rifles to arm them. In 1761 there was an epidemic of smallpox that principally attacked the Indians. Estimates were 14,600 dead in Mexico City and up to 80,000 in Puebla. The government nearly emptied its coffers  to provide what palliative assistance was possible. Viceroy Montserrat took economy measures, ordered the collection of back taxes, and prohibited hoarding of foodstuffs and merchandise. On November 20, 1761, Mayas under Jacinto Canek rose in rebellion in Cisteil, Yucatan. Canek was captured, and on December 14, 1761 he was tortured and quartered in the plaza of Valladolid. Other disasters during Montserrat's term of office included a major flood in Guanajuato that paralyzed the operation of the silver mines , and another epidemic  that caused many deaths . He also had to send military assistance to Sonora, where a revolt of Pimas and Seris had broken out against their maltreatment by the Spanish colonists. The rebels had killed the garrisons of two presidios and the governor before escaping to the mountains, where they were finally subdued.

Passage: The Lions needed all 60 minutes to overcome four turnovers and a minus-6 differential in penalties to overtake the Dallas Cowboys. The game started slowly, with just three scores in the first half. Detroit struck first with a 90-yard drive, highlighted by an 87-yard pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson and capped when the two connected again on a fourth-down 2-yard TD pass. Dallas got a second quarter field goal of 53 yards by Dan Bailey to make the score 7-3. On the Lions next possession, Sean Lee intercepted Stafford for the second time in the game and returned the ball 74 yards to the Lions 4 yard line. Two plays later, Tony Romo hit Dez Bryant with a 5-yard TD pass, giving Dallas a 10-7 halftime lead. Bailey converted on another 53-yard field goal in the third quarter, putting the Cowboys up 13-7. David Akers narrowed the lead to 13-10 with a 20-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter. But Dallas struck on their next possession when Tony Romo connected with Terrance Williams on a 60-yard TD pass play, putting them up by 10. Detroit's Joique Bell capped an 80-yard drive with a 1-yard TD run to cut the lead to 3 again, at 20-17. Dallas again went up 10, as Romo and Bryant hooked up for their second TD pass play of the day, this one going 50 yards. The Lions came back with a 1-yard TD run by Reggie Bush, on a drive that featured a key 54-yard pass from Stafford to Calvin Johnson, cutting the lead to 27-24. The Lions lost the ball on downs with 1:24 left in the game, but Dallas could only take 22 seconds off the clock before Dan Bailey put them up 30-24 with a 44-yard field goal. The Lions began an improbable 80-yard TD drive with just 1:02 remaining on the clock and no time-outs left. Stafford hit Kris Durham with a key 40-yard pass that put the ball at the Cowboys' 23. Stafford then hit Calvin Johnson with a 22-yard pass on the next play that got the ball to the Dallas 1, but the clock was still running. Instead of spiking the ball to stop the clock after the Lions quickly lined up, Matthew Stafford lunged over a pile of linemen and stretched the ball over the goal line for the tying touchdown, with David Akers' extra point giving the Lions a 31-30 victory. The Lions tallied 623 yards of total offense on the afternoon. Stafford was 33-of-48 for 488 yards and one touchdown.  Most of his passing yards were to Calvin Johnson, as the Lions wideout caught 14 balls for 329 yards and one touchdown. Johnson set an NFL record for receiving yards in a regulation game, and was just 7 yards short of the full game record of 336 yards set by Flipper Anderson in a 1989 overtime game. Calvin also tied Lance Alworth's all-time NFL mark with his fifth career game of 200 or more receiving yards. The Lions also became just the second team in the last 56 such games to win despite a minus-4 turnover differential. The only other team to accomplish this was the New England Patriots in a 2007 game against the Miami Dolphins.  Question: How many points were scored by halftime?

{"question": "Fernwood Realty Company developed a residential development, known as the Fernwood Development, which included single-family dwellings, town houses, and high-rise apartments for a total of 25,000 dwelling units. Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee and the grantee's \"heirs and assigns\" agreed to purchase electrical power only from a plant Fernwood promised to build and maintain within the development. Fernwood constructed the plant and the necessary power lines. The plant did not supply power outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was used to determine price. After constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, Fernwood sold its interest in the development to Gaint Realty Investors. Gaint operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from Gaint contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that Fernwood had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made. Page bought a dwelling unit from Olm, who had purchased it from Fernwood. Subsequently, Page, whose lot was along the boundary of the Fernwood development, ceased buying electrical power from Gaint and began purchasing power from General Power Company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the Fernwood development. Both General Power and Gaint have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. Gaint instituted an appropriate action against Page to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power. If judgment is for Page, it most likely will be because: A. The covenant does not touch and concern the land. B. The mixture of types of residential units is viewed as preventing one common development scheme. C. The covenant is a restraint on alienation. D. There is no privity of estate between Page and Gaint.Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.", "answer": "A"}

Context: Maternal diabetes is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, including stillbirth and macrosomia. Evolving data suggest that diabetes during pregnancy also has long-term consequences for offspring, putting them at risk for obesity and the metabolic syndrome in childhood. Because nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is known to occur in adults and children with insulin resistance, we hypothesized that altered lipid metabolism in fetuses of diabetic mothers may manifest with hepatic steatosis.', 'We undertook a retrospective autopsy study to compare the presence and degree of hepatic steatosis between stillborns delivered to women with pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus (gestational age 20-40 weeks; n\\u200a=\\u200a33) and age-matched nondiabetic control stillbirth cases (n\\u200a=\\u200a48), the latter enriched for maternal obesity, macrosomia, and similar cause of demise.', 'Histopathologic hepatic steatosis was significantly more prevalent and severe in the diabetic subjects (26/33, 78.8%) than in the controls (8/48, 16.6%) (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.001). Within the diabetic cohort, the severity of steatosis was related directly to gestational age, birth weight, and liver weight, with no correlation of presence or severity of steatosis in the control group to maternal or fetal factors, including maternal body mass index or fetal macrosomia. Although macrosomic stillborns were more common in diabetic women with %hemoglobin A1c >6 and body mass index >30 kg/m, fetal steatosis was independent of glycemic control, maternal obesity, type of diabetes, ethnicity, or fetal sex in our cohort.\\Question: Is hepatic steatosis prevalent in stillborns delivered to women with diabetes mellitus?", "answer": "This study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate a specific association between fetal hepatic steatosis and maternal diabetes."}

{"question": "Title: Bobby Fischer Background: Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943 - January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time. Bobby Fischer showed great skill in chess from an early age; at 13, he won a brilliancy known as \"The Game of the Century\". At age 14, he became the US Chess Champion, and at 15, he became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship. Section: Early years Passage: Bobby Fischer was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943. His birth certificate listed his father as Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, also known as Gerardo Liebscher, a German biophysicist. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was a US citizen, born in Switzerland; her parents were Polish Jews. Raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Regina became a teacher, registered nurse, and later a physician.  After graduating from college in her teens, Regina traveled to Germany to visit her brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan to go to the United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.  At the time of her son's birth, Regina was \"homeless\" and shuttled to different jobs and schools around the country to support her family. She engaged in political activism, and raised both Bobby and Joan as a single parent.  In 1949, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York City, where she studied for her master's degree in nursing and subsequently began working in that field. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where was he born?

{"question": "Title: Hannah Arendt Background: Johanna \"Hannah\" Arendt (; German: ['a:R@nt]; 14 October 1906 - 4 December 1975) was a German-born American political theorist. Her eighteen books and numerous articles, on topics ranging from totalitarianism to epistemology, had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century. As a Jew, Arendt chose to leave Nazi Germany in 1933, and lived in Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and France before escaping to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. Section: Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil Passage: In her reporting of the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial for The New Yorker, which evolved into Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (1963), she coined the phrase \"the banality of evil\" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She examined the question of whether evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. She was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel. She also was critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably M. C. Rumkowski, acted during the Holocaust. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew, until 1999. This controversy was answered by Hannah Arendt in the book's Postscript.  The controversy began by calling attention to the conduct of the Jewish people during the years of the Final Solution, thus following up the question, first raised by the Israeli prosecutor, of whether the Jews could or should have defended themselves. I had dismissed that question as silly and cruel, since it testified to a fatal ignorance of the conditions at the time. It has now been discussed to exhaustion, and the most amazing conclusions have been drawn. The well-known historico-sociological construct of \"ghetto mentality\"... has been repeatedly dragged in to explain behavior which was not at all confined to the Jewish people and which therefore cannot be explained by specifically Jewish factors... This was the unexpected conclusion certain reviewers chose to draw from the \"image\" of a book, created by certain interest groups, in which I allegedly had claimed that the Jews had murdered themselves.  Arendt ended the book by writing:  Just as you Eichmann supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations--as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world--we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what was the eichmann in Jerusalem?

Five hours later, Soni was dead, one of more than 100 children to die this month from Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), or ‘brain fever’, in one district of eastern Bihar state. “I still see her in my dreams,” said Sahana Khatun, Soni’s mother. “I can’t accept she is gone.”  The deaths were preventable, doctors say, if poor families had access to good food, clean water and better medical care in Muzaffarpur district, 80 km (50 miles) from the state capital Patna. The epidemic has sparked a debate over growing inequality in India and focused attention on a free healthcare scheme for the poor - known as “Modicare” after Prime Minister Narendra Modi - eight months after it was launched. The precise causes of AES, which killed more than 350 in Bihar in 2014, are not known, though a majority of medical professionals say it is linked to a ferocious heat-wave that has gripped Bihar for the last month. Some studies have blamed toxins in lychees, a fruit grown in abundance in orchards around Muzaffarpur, though many families told Reuters their children had not eaten them in recent weeks. The victims come from poor families who often suffer from malnutrition and dehydration, doctors in Muzaffarpur said. If caught quickly, AES patients can often recover with simple rehydration treatment, doctors said, but delayed care can lead to convulsions and eventual death. “It is a preventable disease,” said Dr. Chaitanya Kumar at the district’s Kejriwal Maternity Hospital, one of two treating young AES patients. “Glucose and providing meals to some of the poorest districts – these are not expensive things.”   India has world-class hospitals in major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai, but rural facilities like those in Muzaffarpur are overstretched, doctors say. The 600-bed Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital in Muzaffarpur has more than 900 patients, a third of them children with AES. Ninety-three AES patients have died at the facility since the outbreak began. Stray goats roam over rubbish and rubble on the hospital grounds. The building has frequent power cuts and the stench of urine lingers in the hallways. The hospital evicted a group of sick inmates from a ward to accommodate the surge in AES patients, but at times there are still two or three children assigned to one bed. “It is incredibly difficult to be a doctor in a place like this,” said Ravikant Singh, a volunteer doctor from Mumbai who was giving rehydration solutions to patients at the hospital. Other doctors said they felt powerless. “I can’t do anything. It is the social conditions that have to change,” said Rajkumar Goenka, secretary of the trust that operates Kejriwal hospital. “The government – state and national – has to do something,” he added. Nearly half of all children in Muzaffarpur are underweight, and a similar number are stunted, or too short for their age, according to government data. In Marwan, a village of thatched huts where many residents belong to one of the lowest rungs in India’s caste system, some children have swollen stomachs – a common sign of malnutrition. Residents interviewed by Reuters said they were unaware of Ayushman Bharat, the program known as ‘Modicare’ launched in 2018 to give India’s poorest free access to private healthcare. Nand Lal Mandhji, 61, whose four-year-old granddaughter died from AES, said the family was given a flyer about the scheme during a hospital visit in May. The family is illiterate and the program was not explained to them, he said. “They gave us something but we didn’t understand what it meant,” he said, clutching the flyer with Modi’s image. Eight families in Marwan with sick relatives said they had never heard of Modicare, and did not receive warnings from authorities about the dangers of AES. “No one comes here. Not politicians, health workers, no one,” said Sahana Khatun, Soni’s mother. ($1 = 69.6350 Indian rupees)", "answer": "'Brain fever' blamed for India child deaths preventable: doctors."}

{"question": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document. The title should convey the main idea/event/topic about which the document is being written. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link].   âThe windscreen phenomenon is probably one of the best illustrative ways to realize we are dealing with a decline in flying insects â said  Caspar Hallmann  an ecologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands .  Hallmann  is part of a research team that recently waded through 27 years' worth of insects collected in German nature preserves. The most dramatic reduction over time in bug biomass appeared in summer months  when insects should be most active. âApparently  when insect densities are the highest  declines are most severe. Unfortunately we do not know why â  Hallmann  said.  Hallmann  said the German study should be ârepresentative for parts of the world under similar conditions â which is to say a human-dominated landscape coupled with intensive agriculture. But  he  cannot make more-specific comparisons  because âsimilar data sets do not exist elsewhere  to our knowledge â  he  said. The authors of the new study attempted to tease out the roots of the decline. The scientists' investigation into climatic changes and other variables  however  eliminated most âprime suspects â  Hallmann  said. (In fact  the temperature increase observed over the study period should have benefited flying insects   he  said.) One culprit could be the alteration of the landscape itself  the agriculture that surrounds the preserves. âThis suggests a possible role for  for example  fertilizer and pesticide application â  Hallmann  said.", "answer": "Flying insects have been disappearing over the past few decades study shows"}

{"question": "Fossil-fuel producers say that it would be prohibitively expensive to reduce levels of carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels enough to halt global warming. This claim is probably false. Several years ago, the chemical industry said that finding an economical alternative to the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) destroying the ozone layer would be impossible. Yet once the industry was forced, by international agreements, to find substitutes for CFCs, it managed to phase them out completely well before the mandated deadline, in many cases at a profit. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: There are ways of reducing carbon dioxide emissions that could halt global warming without hurting profits of fossil-fuel producers significantly more than phasing out CFCs hurt those of the chemical industry. B: The use of CFCs never contributed as greatly to the destruction of the ozone layer as the carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels currently contributes to global warming. C: In some countries, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels has already been reduced without prohibitive expense, but at some cost in convenience to the users of such fuels. D: If international agreements forced fossil-fuel producers to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions enough to halt global warming, the fossil-fuel producers could find substitutes for fossil fuels.Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.", "answer": "A"}
{"question": "Title: Van Halen Background: Van Halen is an American hard rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. Section: A temporary reunion with Roth (1996) Passage: David Lee Roth called Eddie to discuss what tracks would be included on a planned Van Halen compilation (work on which had actually begun before Hagar's departure). They got along well, and Eddie invited him up to his house/studio. Shortly afterwards, Roth re-entered the studio with the band and producer Glen Ballard. Two songs from those sessions were added to the band's Greatest Hits album and released as singles to promote it.  In September, Van Halen was asked to present an award at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards. They agreed, and on September 4, 1996, the four original members of Van Halen made their first public appearance together in over eleven years. This helped to bring the compilation to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. However, unknown to Roth, Eddie and Alex were still auditioning other singers, including Mitch Malloy.  The band's appearance on the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards fueled reunion speculation. But several weeks after the awards show, it was discovered that Roth was out of Van Halen again. Roth released a statement in which he apologized to the media and the fans, stating that he was an unwitting participant in a publicity stunt by Van Halen and manager Ray Danniels. The next day, Eddie and Alex released their own statement, claiming they had been completely honest with Roth and had never suggested he was guaranteed to be the next lead singer.  Eddie Van Halen would later explain (in regard to the MTV Video Music Awards appearance) that he had initially been embarrassed by Roth's antics while on camera behind Beck, who was giving an acceptance speech for the award that Van Halen had presented to him. Immediately following this, the band had been taken to a backstage press conference where press queries about a reunion tour were met with Eddie Van Halen saying that he needed a hip replacement and would have to record an entire new studio album before any tour. In private Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about negative things like his hip and the two almost came to blows, thereby shattering any chance of a full-scale reunion. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did David Lee Roth return? Answer: 1996 Question: Was his return short lived?

Passage: In the early 1980s, Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound, with compilations such as ZE's Mutant Disco (1981) highlighting a newly playful sensibility borne out of the city's clash of hip hop, disco and punk styles, as well as dub reggae and world music influences. Artists such as Liquid Liquid, the B-52s, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks and Lizzy Mercier Descloux pursued a formula described by Luc Sante as \"anything at all + disco bottom\". The decadent parties and art installations of venues such as Club 57 and the Mudd Club became cultural hubs for musicians and visual artists alike, with figures such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Michael Holman frequenting the scene.

{"question": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.   Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : My mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer a couple years ago, went through chemo, and is now in remission.  My husband and I only see her once a year due to the distance and their strained relationship. She and my husband talk on the phone about once a month. Typically, she will ask him how he’s doing, how I’m doing, and then she will talk about herself for the rest of the conversation. For example, on his birthday, she asked what we were doing for his birthday and then shortly after he answered, she started talking about how she’s scared the cancer is going to come back. (My husband’s birthday is around the time of her second birthday.) My husband said he preferred not to talk about that on his birthday (this was the first time they had spoken in weeks) and tried to steer the conversation in another direction. Then she started talking about someone else she knew who has cancer. He said he had to go and he’d talk to her later.   A couple months ago, we invited her into town for a big celebration for my husband. We invited her, her husband, and a couple of my husband’s friends for dinner at a nice restaurant. My mother-in-law started talking to one of my husband’s friends about her cancer treatment and started playing a slideshow (complete with music) on her phone of her during treatment. My husband told her to turn it off as it wasn’t the time or place as we were in the middle of dinner. It was very loud and other people in the restaurant were starring.  Most of the conversations with her seem to be focused around her cancer story, someone she knows who is sick, her final wishes, etc. Like clockwork, if there’s a lull in the conversation, she will start up about something regarding her treatment. I will politely listen but my husband will usually chime in that we should talk about something else.  Are my husband and I the assholes because we don’t want to listen or talk about my mother-in-law’s cancer the few times we talk or see her every year?", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "Title: Mohanlal Background: Mohanlal Viswanathan was born in the village of Elanthoor in the Pathanamthitta district on 21 May 1960. He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and law secretary with the Kerala Government, and Santhakumari. He grew up at Mudavanmugal, Poojappura, at his paternal house in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College in Thiruvananthapuram. Section: Stage performances Passage: Mohanlal had acted in several amateur plays before entering into films. In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in Karnabharam, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 as part of the National Theatre Festival of the National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said: \"You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It is almost like a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging\". He acted without payment, saying: \"I performed for the joy of it ... for my love of our history\".  Kadhayattam was a presentation enacted by Mohanlal, performing ten classic characters and situations from Malayalam literature, selected from ten Malayalam novels written by O. Chandu Menon, C. V. Raman Pillai, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, P. Kesavadev, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Uroob, O. V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan, and M. T. Vasudevan Nair over a 100-year period. The play, directed by T. K. Rajeev Kumar premiered at the Senate Hall of University of Kerala on 1 November 2003, and later was staged in Kozhikode, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. In 2008, Mohanlal along with Mukesh performed in Chayamukhi, written and directed by Prasanth Narayanan. Mohanlal and Mukesh portrayed Bheeman and Keechakan respectively, the characters from Mahabharata. It had a play within a play narrative style. It premiered at the Lulu International Convention Centre in Thrissur on 12 March 2008, and later was staged in Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, Kollam, Kochi, and Kozhikode. A critic from The Hindu wrote: \"Chayamukhi is, arguably, the finest work on Malayalam stage in recent times\". In the same year, Mohanlal voiced Hanuman in the English ballet Maya Ravan, directed by Shobana.  In 2014, Mohanlal and musician Ratheesh Vegha formed the music band Lalisom - The Lal Effect. Its maiden show was at the 2015 National Games of India. The band drew flak from social media initially for charging an amount of Rs1.63 crore and later for lip-syncing. Following the criticism, Mohanlal returned the amount to the government, which they refused stating that the government's morality would not allow to take back the money and Mohanlal had not personally benefited from the amount which he received, since it was meant to meet the stage expenses and remuneration for the artistes. Despite that, Mohanlal did not take back the money he dispatched.  In 2015, he collaborated once again with Mukesh for Naga, but this time as the narrator. The play, based on Girish Karnad's Kannada play Nagamandala, was directed by Suveeran. Naga was a combination of myth, superstition, fact, and fantasy. It was premiered at the Parish Hall of St. George Church, Kalady on 9 August 2015. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What stage performances did he have? Answer: Kadhayattam was a presentation enacted by Mohanlal, performing ten classic characters and situations from Malayalam literature, Question: When did he act in Kadhayattam?

{"question": "Title: Vedic period Background: The Vedic period or Vedic age (c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE) is the period in the history of the Indian subcontinent intervening between the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization, and a second urbanisation which began in c. 600 BCE. It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. Section: Origins Passage: The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. After the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which ended c. 1900 BCE, groups of Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into north-western India and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which--according to the most widespread hypothesis--have originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan.  Some writers and archaeologists have opposed the notion of a migration of Indo-Aryans into India. Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton used the term \"Indo-Aryan Controversy\" for an oversight of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory, and some of its opponents. These ideas are outside the academic mainstream. Mallory and Adams note that two types of models \"enjoy significant international currency\" as to the Indo-European homeland, namely the Anatolian hypothesis, and a migration out of the Eurasian steppes. According to Upinder Singh, \"The original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and Indo-Aryans is the subject of continuing debate among philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists and others. The dominant view is that the Indo-Aryans came to the subcontinent as immigrants. Another view, advocated mainly by some Indian scholars, is that they were indigenous to the subcontinent.\"  The knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda-samhita, i. e. the oldest layer of the Vedas, which was composed c. 1500-1200 BCE. They brought with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\", which borrowed \"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture. CANNOTANSWER  Question: when did the Vedic period start? Answer: The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. Question: Are there specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period? Answer: The Question: What were the people like in the beginning? Answer: The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion.

{"question": "Title: Scarlett Johansson Background: Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York. Her father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, and her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was an art historian, screenwriter and film director, whose own father was Swedish. Johansson's mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family of Polish and Belarusian descent. She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; and a twin brother, Hunter. Section: Public image Passage: Johansson has been called \"ScarJo\" by the media and fans, but dislikes the nickname, finding it lazy, flippant and insulting. She is described as a sex symbol by the media, which considers her lips, green eyes, and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as \"the embodiment of male fantasy\". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen commented on her attractiveness. In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that \"she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation.\" Johansson said that she disliked being sexualized, and that a preoccupation with a person's attractiveness does not last. She lost the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was \"too sexy\" for the part.  Johansson ranks highly in several beauty listings. Maxim included her in their Hot 100 from 2006 to 2014. She has been named \"Sexiest Woman Alive\" twice by Esquire (2006 and 2013), and has been included in similar listings by Playboy (2007), Men's Health (2011), and FHM (since 2005). She was named GQ's Babe of the Year in 2010. Madame Tussauds New York museum installed a wax sculpture of her in 2015.  Johansson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2004. In 2006, Johansson appeared on Forbes' Celebrity 100, and again in 2014 and 2015. Johansson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2012. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, she was one of the highest-paid actresses, with annual earnings of $17 million, $35.5  million, and $25 million, respectively. She was the highest-grossing actor of 2016, with a total of $1.2 billion. As a result, IndieWire praised her for taking on risky roles. As of May 2017, Johansson is the highest-grossing actress of all time in North America, with her films making over $3.6 billion.  Johansson has appeared in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, L'Oreal, and Louis Vuitton, and has represented the Spanish brand Mango since 2009. Johansson was the first Hollywood celebrity to represent a champagne producer, appearing in advertisements for Moet & Chandon. In January 2014, the Israeli company SodaStream, which makes home-carbonation products, hired Johansson as its first global brand ambassador, a relationship that commenced with a television commercial during Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. This proved controversial, as SodaStream is based in Israeli-occupied territory in the West Bank. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what is a hallmark of her personal image?

{"question": "Title: Dražen Petrović Background: Drazen Petrovic (pronounced [draZen petrovitc]; October 22, 1964 - June 7, 1993) was a Croatian professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. Section: Yugoslavia Passage: Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.  The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.  An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

{"question": "Title: Yoko Ono Background: Yoko Ono (born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese multimedia artist, singer, songwriter, and peace activist who is also known for her work in performance art and filmmaking. She performs in both English and Japanese. She is known for being the second wife and widow of singer-songwriter John Lennon of the Beatles. Ono grew up in Tokyo and also spent several formative years in New York City. Section: Early life and family Passage: Ono was born on February 18, 1933, in Tokyo, Japan, to Isoko Ono (Xiao Ye  Ji Zi , Ono Isoko) and Eisuke Ono (Xiao Ye  Ying Fu , Ono Eisuke), a wealthy banker and former classical pianist. Isoko's father was ennobled in 1915. Isoko's maternal grandfather Zenjiro Yasuda (An Tian  Shan Ci Lang , Yasuda Zenjiro) was an affiliate of the Yasuda clan and zaibatsu. Eisuke came from a long line of samurai warrior-scholars. The kanji translation of Yoko (Yang Zi ) means \"ocean child.\"  Two weeks before Ono's birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco by his employer, the Yokohama Specie Bank. The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono meeting her father when she was two. Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936. Ono was enrolled in piano lessons from the age of 4. In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's elite Gakushuin (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan.  The family moved to New York City in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to Hanoi, and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the Mitsui family. She remained in Tokyo throughout World War II and the great fire-bombing of March 9, 1945, during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special bunker in Tokyo's Azabu district, far from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the Karuizawa mountain resort with members of her family.  Starvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family were forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings with them in a wheelchair. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her \"aggressive\" attitude and understanding of \"outsider\" status when children--who were once well-to-do--taunted her and her brother. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods with them to the countryside, where they were bartered for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made sewing machine for 60 kilograms (130 lb) of rice to feed the family. During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a prisoner of war camp in China. However, unbeknownst the them, he remained in the city. Ono told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now on October 16, 2007, that \"He was in French Indochina, which is Vietnam actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp.\"  By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. She graduated in 1951 and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What are the names of Yoko Ono's parents? Answer: Isoko Ono (Xiao Ye  Ji Zi , Ono Isoko) and Eisuke Ono (Xiao Ye  Ying Fu , Ono Eisuke), Question: Did Yoko Ono have any siblings? Answer: two.

{"question": "Find the volume of a solid bounded by the elliptical paraboloid $z=2x^2 + y^2 + 1$, the plane x+y=1, and the coordinate planes. Relevant Theorem: In geometry, volume refers to the measure of the three-dimensional space occupied by an object or a closed shape. It is typically expressed in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic meters (m³), or cubic inches (in³). Volume is an important concept in various fields, including science, engineering, and mathematics.  Calculating the volume of an object depends on its shape. For example, the volume of a rectangular prism can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height (V = lwh), while the volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.  In general, the volume of an object can be found by integrating the area of its cross-sections along a particular axis or by using specific formulas for different shapes.", "answer": "0.75"}

Note that you don't need to write a complete sentence as a summary.   I've owned this product for about a year already and it is still working completely fine; although, there was a few technical issues I had to figure out myself. There's no problem with the Blue Icicle itself though. There would be a problem when trying to install this with Windows 7. There was no problem at all using it with Windows XP. It seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being 'Blue Icicle'. Instead, it would show up as 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device'. It just didn't sound the same when I was using it with Windows XP. It sounded more louder with some feedback in the background. What I did to fix this problem was to uninstall the 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device' driver from Device Manager, then unplug the Icicle and plug it back in. When the 'Installing device driver software' notification pops up, click it and click 'Skip obtaining driver software from Windows Update'. It will now be installed as 'Blue Icicle' and work like how it should be! Make sure you raise the levels up in Sound in Control Panel if the mic sounds too low for you, even with the Gain Control Volume up; it shouldn't be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background.

Immunopathol., In this report, we describe an in vitro culture method for feline bone marrow cells, which yields large numbers of quiescent macrophages after 14 days of culture. The bulk of the cultured cell population consists of macrophages as assessed by morphology, macrophage specific cytochemistry, and phagocytosis. The remaining cells were lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts and occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes. While resting cells produced no detectable interleukin 1, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the production of biologically active interleukin 1. After 6 h LPS stimulation, mRNA for tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin lfl was detectable. The absence of mRNA in unstimulated cells indicates cultured macrophages were not activated until stimulated by LPS or plastic adherence. This approach provides a useful means to measure potential modulatory effects by virus infections or other agents upon feline macrophage gene expression.

In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis, we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2.

I wouldn't buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.

Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.  The mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy, and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant.  The flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint, as it should be.

{"question": "Title: Will Forte Background: Orville Willis Forte IV was born in Alameda County, California. His father, Orville Willis Forte III, is a financial broker, and his mother, Patricia C. (nee Stivers), is an artist and former schoolteacher. He was raised in Moraga, before moving to Lafayette. He went by Billy in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name, at which point he decided he would from there on be known as Will. Section: Early career (1997-2001) Passage: He began taking classes at the Groundlings in Los Angeles, an improvisational and sketch comedy troupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. Forte's first successful foray into comedy was 101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, a comic book he produced that details incompetent men. The comics landed him his first professional job writing for The Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-lived variety show starring Jenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to the Late Show with David Letterman and was told Letterman responded favorably to animation. After only nine months at Letterman, he was \"let go\" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing. \"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there.\"  Forte returned to Los Angeles and began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, with Cheryl Hines, Jim Rash and Maya Rudolph. He tried stand-up comedy three times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company. He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, including The Army Show and Action. Forte got jobs writing for 3rd Rock from the Sun and That '70s Show, two successful programs. He loved writing but had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings. While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted by Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live (SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, as That '70s Show had been picked up for two more years. He was invited to audition for SNL, which he regarded as unexpected.  At his audition for SNL, he performed multiple original characters, including Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singer Michael McDonald and actor Martin Sheen. His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performs fellatio to pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words \"cock\" and \"face paint\" dozens of times. He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned. To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work at That '70s Show.

{"question": "Let f be a real function on [0,1]. If the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0), then: (a) f is increasing on [0,1]; (b) f is decreasing on [0,1]; (c) None of the above. Which one is correct? Relevant Theorem: In real analysis, Bounded Variation refers to a property of functions that measures the total amount of \"variation\" or \"change\" in the function over a given interval. A function is said to be of bounded variation on an interval [a, b] if the total variation of the function on that interval is finite. The total variation is defined as the supremum of the sum of the absolute differences of the function's values at consecutive points in any partition of the interval.  More formally, let f: [a, b] → R be a real-valued function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. The function f is said to be of bounded variation on [a, b] if there exists a constant M such that for any partition P = {a = x_0, x_1, ..., x_n = b} of the interval [a, b], the following inequality holds:  Σ |f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})| ≤ M for i = 1, 2, ..., n  Here, Σ denotes the sum over all i, and |f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})| represents the absolute difference between the function's values at consecutive points in the partition.  Functions of bounded variation have several important properties and applications in real analysis, including the fact that they can be expressed as the difference of two increasing functions. They also play a crucial role in the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, a generalization of the Riemann integral, where the integrator is allowed to be a function of bounded variation instead of just a continuous function.", "answer": "(a)"}

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a sound engineer.

{"question": "Title: The Monkees Background: The Monkees were an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and British actor and singer Davy Jones. Section: From television to concert stage Passage: In assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as to which of the four would be the drummer. Both Nesmith (a skilled guitarist and bassist) and Tork (who could play several stringed and keyboard instruments) were peripherally familiar with the instrument but both declined to give the drum set a try. Jones knew how to play the drums and tested well enough initially on the instrument, but the producers felt that, behind a drum kit, the camera would exaggerate his short stature and make him virtually hidden from view. Thus, Dolenz (who only knew how to play the guitar) was assigned to become the drummer. Tork taught Dolenz his first few beats on the drums, enough for him to fake his way through filming the pilot, but he was soon taught how to play properly. Thus, the lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, Dolenz on drums and Jones as a frontman, singer and percussionist. This, however, is in opposition to the lineup which would have made the most sense based upon the members' musical strengths. For example, Tork was actually a more experienced guitar player than Nesmith, while Nesmith had at one time specifically trained on the bass. While Jones certainly had a strong lead voice and sings lead on several Monkees recordings, Dolenz's voice is regarded, particularly by Nesmith, as one of the most distinctive in popular music history and a hallmark of the Monkees' sound. This theoretical lineup was actually depicted once, in the music video for the band's song \"Words\", which shows Jones on drums, Tork playing lead guitar, Nesmith on bass and Dolenz fronting the group. In concert appearances Tork also took much of the guitar duties, even in appearances with Nesmith, and Dolenz often plays rhythm guitar on stage.  Unlike most television shows of the time, The Monkees episodes were written with many setups, requiring frequent breaks to prepare the set and cameras for short bursts of filming. Some of the \"bursts\" are considered proto-music videos, inasmuch as they were produced to sell the records. The Monkees Tale author Eric Lefcowitz noted that the Monkees were--first and foremost--a video group. The four actors would spend 12-hour days on the set, many of them waiting for the production crew to do their jobs. Noticing that their instruments were left on the set unplugged, the four decided to turn them on and start playing.  After working on the set all day, the Monkees (usually Dolenz or Jones) would be called into the recording studio to cut vocal tracks. As the band was essential to this aspect of the recording process, there were few limits on how long they could spend in the recording studio, and the result was an extensive catalogue of unreleased recordings. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What happened with The Monkees were on television?

{"question": "In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage.   What are the only words that appear in a language different than English in the text?, Context: Luther's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord's Prayer, \"Vater unser im Himmelreich\", corresponds exactly to Luther's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism, with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas. The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions. The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune. Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord's Prayer have adopted Luther's tune, although modern texts are considerably shorter.", "answer": "Vater unser im Himmelreich"}

{"question": "Article: (CNN) -- It's the million-dollar reward that's raising a million-dollar question: Who, if anyone, is entitled to the money offered in the hunt for Christopher Dorner? The catch is that Dorner, the rogue former Los Angeles police officer who sparked a massive manhunt, was never captured. He died after a shootout and fire at a California mountain cabin this week after, authorities say, he killed four people and wounded three others. The city of Los Angeles put up the $1 million reward Sunday, together with other jurisdictions, groups, and private donors. It had been a few days since Dorner was last seen, and they wanted to generate tips. Dorner died from single gunshot to head . \"Collectively this group, led by my office, is posting a reward of $1 million for information that will lead to Mr. Dorner's capture,\" said Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. Now that the hunt for Dorner is over, the Los Angeles Police Department says it's deciding what to do with the reward money. \"More than 20 jurisdictions and entities are involved in this reward, so all of them will be coming together to collectively determine whether any individual(s) qualify for it,\" the LAPD said in a statement Friday. \"Our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed, but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity.\" Former girlfriend: Dorner was stressed out . The police department said they have had a lot of inquiries about the reward. It reminded the public that no money can be distributed until the investigation is complete. One person who feels he deserves the reward is camp ranger Rick Heltebrake, one of Dorner's last victims. Heltebrake was driving Tuesday near Big Bear Lake, California, when Dorner approached him, put a gun to his head and stole his truck. Dorner was on the run from California Fish and Wildlife wardens who had spotted him on the area's icy roads. Dorner and the wardens exchanged gunfire before Dorner crashed his car, carjacked Heltebrake's truck and drove it to the nearby cabin. Ex-LAPD cop gains sympathizers on social media . After Dorner drove off, Heltebrake said he ducked off the road and called his friend, a sheriff's deputy, to alert him. Speaking Thursday to CNN about the reward, Heltebrake said, \"I do think I deserve it. I believe it was my phone call to that sheriff's deputy that directed them to the location where Dorner was, and I believe it was my phone call that put an end to the largest manhunt in Los Angeles history.\" Heltebrake said he wants to use the reward money to set up college funds for the children of the two law enforcement officers killed by Dorner. He also mentioned possible improvements to the scout camp where he works, which he said is rundown. \"Did anybody ever believe that he was going to be captured and convicted? I don't think so,\" Heltebrake told CNN's Randi Kaye. \"I think they put that (clause) in there possibly to have an out for later. I believe that that money was put up by the private sector and basically corporate donors, not from taxpayer money or anything like that, and I believe those people wanted that money to go somewhere, and I'd like to do some good with it.\" Heltebrake said he could split the money with Karen and Jim Reynolds, the couple who encountered Dorner in their Big Bear-area condo Tuesday morning, before the carjacking. Though Dorner tied up the couple, they managed to free themselves and call 911. \"If they want half of it, I believe they're deserving of half of it,\" Heltebrake said. Speaking Wednesday after their ordeal, the Reynolds said they were simply happy to be alive and hadn't thought much about the reward money.

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.   Passage: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \"tragic\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's entertainment. Finally, librettist Giovacchino Forzano presented the composer with two works of his own, which became Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi. The latter would be Puccini's first setting of a comic text; although his earlier operas, for example La bohème, contain comic episodes, these are merely ancillary to the drama to provide contrast.Forzano wrote to Tito Ricordi, Giulio's son, on 3 March 1917: I sent the libretto of Suor Angelica to Maestro Puccini some days ago. He has declared himself – kind as he is – very satisfied ... I have also finished a brief outline of a plot based on Gianni Schicchi. You know the Maestro's opinion of this subject, which is rich in possibilities and whose comic nature is quite out of the ordinary.  Question: What is the name of the person who considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi?", "answer": "Puccini."}

Article: Interactive television advertising,which allows viewers to use their remote controls to click on advertisements, has been pushed for years. Nearly a decade ago it was predicted that viewers of \"Friends\", a popular situation comedy, would soon be able to purchase a sweater like Jennifer Aniston's with a few taps on their remote control. \"it's been the year of interactive television advertising for the last ten or twelve years,\" says Collin Dixon of a digital-media consultancy. So the news that Cablevision, an American cable company, was rolling out interactive advertisements to all its customers on October 6th was greeted with some skepticism. During commercials, an overlay will appear at the bottom of the screen, prompting viewers to press a button to request a free sample or order a catalogue. Cablevision hopes to allow customers to buy things with their remote controls early next year. Television advertising could do with a boost. Spending fell by 10% in the first half of the year. The popularization of digital video recorders has caused advertisers to worry that their commercials will be skipped. Some are turning to the Internet, which is cheaper and offers concrete measurements like click-through rates-especially important at a time when marketing budgets are tight. With the launch of interactive advertising, \"many of the dollars that went to the Internet will come back to the TV,\" says David Kline of Cablevision. Or so the industry hopes. In theory, interactive advertising can engage viewers in a way that 30-second spot or not. Unilever recently ran an interactive campaign for its Axe deodorant , which kept viewers engaged for more than three minutes on average. The amount spent on interactive advertising on television is still small. Magna, an advertising agency, reckons it will be worth about $138 million this year. That falls far short of the billions of dollars people once expected it to generate. But DirecTV, Comcast and Time Warner Cable have all invested in it.  Yet there are doubts whether people watching television, a \"lean back\" medium, crave interaction. Click-through rates have been high so far (around3-4%, compared with less than 0.3% online), but that may be a result of the novelty. Interactive ads and viewers might not go well together.   Question: By  saying \"It's been the year of interactive television advertising for the last ten or twelve years\"Colin Dixon means_.   Options: (A) Interactive television advertising has not achieved the anticipated results. (B) Interactive television advertising is successful when incorporated into situation comedies. (C) Interactive television advertising has been under debate for the last decade or so. (D) Interactive television advertising will become popular in 10-12 years.", "answer": "A"}

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.   How long should you leave your teabag in? 25 seconds EXACTLY: Expert arrives at formula for perfect cuppa after drinking 400 brews in 48 hours. 1  Professional food and drink taster believes 25 seconds is perfect brew time. 2  Martin Isark, 59, drank 400 cups of tea in 48 hours to come to the conclusion. Tea brewing time has long been a hot topic, and in 2011 a team of academics devised a mathematical formula claiming to prove the perfect cuppa is best drunk exactly six minutes after being made. The optimum brew time, they found, was two minutes. The effect can be subtle for a slightly aged look or deep and dark for a truly ancient looking document, all depending on how long you soak the paper and how many teabags you use. Steep two or three tea bags in a cup of hot water for five to 10 minutes. Use inexpensive tea bags as long as the bag is sturdy and not easily torn. Remove the tea bags from the water and allow them to cool completely before handling them. Brush the front and back of the paper evenly with a tea bag. Place the paper on a flat surface covered with newspapers. Allow the paper to dry thoroughly and inspect it for any imperfections. If the paper is too light, brush it again until you ... Steep your tea bag in hot water for at least three minutes to allow the tea to release its full potential. Before you put the tea bag in the cup, give it a gentle shake. This will loosen any compacted tea, allowing the water to flow freely through the tea leaves. Once the tea bag is in the water, there's no need to move it around. Tea bags should be left in your hot water for  three to five minutes. If you like a stronger cup of tea, soak two tea bags at the same time, or soak one after the other for three to five minutes each. Using pyramid tea bags can provide a stronger flavor as well, as they offer a better circulation of water around the tea. How long should you leave your teabag in? 25 seconds EXACTLY: Expert arrives at formula for perfect cuppa after drinking 400 brews in 48 hours. Professional food and drink taster believes 25 seconds is perfect brew time; Martin Isark, 59, drank 400 cups of tea in 48 hours to come to the conclusion ‘Any less, and there’s not enough flavour, any longer, and there’s too much tannin, giving your tea a horrible stewed taste,’ said Mr Isark, who tested bags from Tetley, Typhoo, PG Tips, Twinings and Yorkshire – which together account for 81 per cent of the British tea market. Bottom Line. Tea bags should be left in your hot water for three to five minutes. If you like a stronger cup of tea, soak two tea bags at the same time, or soak one after the other for three to five minutes each. Using pyramid tea bags can provide a stronger flavor as well, as they offer a better circulation of water around the tea. It's a debate that’s been brewing almost as long as there’s been tea: just how long should you leave the bag to stew? Now at last one expert has what he says is the definitive answer – and it is a result that goes against everything the manufacturers say.

{"question": "Title: Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew Background: Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, later called simply Rehab with Dr. Drew, is a reality television show that aired on the cable network VH1 in which many of the episodes chronicle a group of well-known people as they are treated for alcohol and drug addiction by Dr. Drew Pinsky and his staff at the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California. The first five seasons of the series, on which Pinsky also serves as executive producer, cast celebrities struggling with addiction, with the first season premiering on January 10, 2008, and the fifth airing in 2011. The sixth season, which filmed in early 2012, featured non-celebrities as treatment subjects, and the series name shortened to Rehab with Dr. Drew. Season 6 premiered on September 16, 2012. Section: Outcome Passage: Sierra, Binzer, and Carey agreed to enter a transitional sober living home in the season finale. All three, as well as Laurer and Foxworth, would eventually relapse; some re-entered treatment. VH1 aired a reunion special detailing the patients' lives since filming. Although Conaway was able to maintain sobriety from alcohol and cocaine, he continued to abuse analgesics for his back pain, and would re-enter treatment in the show's second season. Binzer also appeared in several episodes of the second season for his relapses, as well as the Sober House spin-off series. Laurer was hospitalized in December 2008 and was reportedly going back to rehab. She later was found dead in her house on April 20, 2016.  Nielsen and Rodriguez have reportedly maintained their sobriety. Pinsky has said on numerous occasions that Nielsen has quit drinking and also gave up smoking. Nielsen has also appeared on his radio shows to talk about her sobriety. In 2009, she appeared as a panel speaker to another group at the Pasadena Recovery Center, in which she anticipated the upcoming two-year mark of her sobriety that July, as seen in a third-season episode of the series, which aired in February 2010. Sierra has tested \"clean and sober\" for a year and a half following a court-ordered year of treatment at the Pasadena Recovery Center, She also appeared with Nielsen in the aforementioned third-season episode, marking her 18 months of sobriety.  The status of Baldwin's sobriety is unknown. As of May 2009, Foxworth is reportedly sober and gave birth to a son. Carey relapsed and returned to porn, starring in and directing a parody film called Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw, a decision which Pinsky said saddened him. Regarding her sobriety, Pinsky commented in a January 2010 TV Guide story, \"She puts together, like, six weeks at a time of sobriety, then drifts away.

Background Paragraph: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent.  Story: Bradly had a busy day storing XML. At 6 AM, he stored 200 Gigabytes to the database. At 7 AM, he stored 300 Gigabytes to the database. At 8 AM, he stored 400 Gigabytes to the database. At 9 AM, he got breakfast. At 10 AM, he stored 500 Gigabytes to the database. At 11 AM, he stored 600 Gigabytes to the database. At 12 PM, she went to sleep to finish storing XML later.  Question: What time did storage costs go up:  7 AM or 12 PM?", "answer": "7 AM."}

PUBLISHED: . 10:11 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:44 EST, 30 November 2012 . Ambulance crews have been blasted for endangering public safety after paramedics stopped to pick up an injured badger and gave it a lift to the vets - where it was put down. Rescue teams spotted the injured animal as they returned from taking a patient to hospital at 3am on October 28. Their Good Samaritan act has been criticised by a whistleblower who claims they put public health at risk. The badger (not pictured) was spotted at the side of the road by paramedics who rushed it to the vets in their Ambulance (not pictured) - prompting fears for public health . South Central Ambulance Service NHS . Foundation Trust (SCAS) admitted crews transported the badger after . spotting it on the road near Banbury, Oxon. A worker wrote on Facebook: 'We found an injured badger in the road about 3am on night shift the other night. 'I rang my vet and we took it down to her in the ambulance. She put it down (it was too far gone for saving). :(' But the whistleblower, who has not been named, accused the service of endangering patients’ safety. They said: 'My concern is that it sounds like a dying wild badger was transported to a vet via an emergency ambulance. 'This is obviously a risk to patients and to the public - the chance of infection e.g badger tuberculosis, the risk of a patient being allergic to badger hair, possible badger bodily fluids etc. 'Was the ambulance thoroughly cleaned afterwards? Are people happy knowing their tax money was spent on transporting an ill badger?' SCAS confirmed staff had used an ambulance to transport an injured badger to a veterinary practice in Banbury on October 28, but denied there was any risk to public health. Spokesman James Keating-Wilkes said: 'In the early hours of October 28 an ambulance crew returning from hospital to base encountered what they believed to be a dead badger in the road in Banbury and, believing that this posed a danger to other road users, stopped to move it to the side of the road. 'On approaching the animal the crew noticed that the badger was alive and in considerable distress. 'They contacted a local vet who asked them to bring the badger in to a veterinary practice approximately half a mile from the scene, which they did. South Central Ambulance Service has a compassionate and caring workforce. The crew’s actions will be reviewed. At no point was patient safety compromised.' Despite the efforts to save the badger, it was taken to West Bar Veterinary Surgery in Banbury, Oxon., where it was put down.

Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics  Section: Development and inspirations Passage: After the success of National Comics' new superhero characters Superman and Batman, Fawcett Publications started its own comics division in 1939, recruiting writer Bill Parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled Flash Comics. Besides penning stories featuring Ibis the Invincible, Spy Smasher, Golden Arrow, Lance O'Casey, Scoop Smith, and Dan Dare for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.  Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called \"Captain Thunder\". Staff artist Charles Clarence \"C. C.\" Beck was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat cartoony style that became his trademark. \"When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett's first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were,\" Beck told an interviewer. \"We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times\".

{"question": "Title: Duff McKagan Background: Michael Andrew McKagan grew up in Seattle's largely working-class University District, the youngest of eight children born to Marie and Elmer \"Mac\" McKagan. He has been called \"Duff\" since toddlerhood, to which he once referred as \"an Irish thing\". Following his parents' divorce, his mother supported the family by taking a job as a medical stenographer. He was taught how to play bass by his brother Bruce, further developing his skills by playing along with the albums 1999 by Prince and Damaged by Black Flag. Section: 1979-1985: Early years Passage: In 1979, at the age of 15, McKagan formed the punk band the Vains, in which he played bass; they released the single \"School Jerks\" in 1980. During this time, he also played guitar in the punk band the Living, which opened shows for Husker Du and D.O.A., which developed a devoted following.  In 1980, McKagan joined the pop-punk band the Fastbacks as their drummer. He appeared on their 1981 debut single \"It's Your Birthday\", which was issued on guitarist Kurt Bloch's label No Threes Records, and on the song \"Someone Else's Room\", which was included on the Seattle Syndrome Volume One compilation album, also released in 1981.  In 1982, McKagan became the drummer for the hardcore punk band The Fartz, with whom he recorded several demos, five of which were included on their 1990 album You, We See You Crawling.

Answering an ad for a bass guitarist in a local newspaper, he met guitarist Slash and drummer Steven Adler, with whom he formed the short-lived band Road Crew. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what would become the Guns N' Roses song \"Rocket Queen\".

In Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15-year-old David Rice (Max Thieriot) gives his crush, Millie Harris (AnnaSophia Robb), a snow globe. A bully, Mark Kobold (Jesse James), throws it onto a frozen river. While trying to retrieve it, David falls through the ice and is pulled away by the current. He suddenly finds himself in the local library and discovers his ability to \"jump\" from one place to another. Amazed with his new ability, he leaves his abusive father (Michael Rooker) and runs away from home.Eight years later, an adult David (Hayden Christensen) lives lavishly on stolen money. One day, he is ambushed in his home by Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), a member of the Paladins, a group of religious extremists who have been tracking down and killing \"Jumpers\". Their reasoning is that Jumpers' alleged omnipresence is considered blasphemous. Roland tries to capture David with electric cables designed to nullify his ability, but David escapes. He returns to Ann Arbor, seeking his old crush Millie (Rachel Bilson). When Mark (Teddy Dunn) attacks him, David teleports him into a bank vault and leaves him there. David then returns to Millie and invites her on a trip to Rome. Roland later discovers Mark in police custody and learns David's identity.In Rome, David and Millie grow closer, though he keeps his ability a secret. They visit the Colosseum, where David meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), another Jumper. A group of Paladins appear, and Griffin casually kills them, then jumps away. David tries to leave with Millie, but he's detained by Italian police and questioned about the deaths. David's mother, Mary (Diane Lane), who had left him when he was five, appears and helps him escape. She urges him to leave Rome with Millie, to protect her. Millie, upset and afraid when David tries to skirt around the issue, demands to know the truth. David declines and puts her on a plane home.David runs into Griffin again, and follows him to his hideout in a cave. Griffin reveals that he has been trailing and killing Paladins for years and plans to kill Roland to avenge his parents. David sees Mary's photo on the wall and realizes she is also a Paladin. Griffin tells David that the Paladins will target his loved ones to draw him out. David teleports home and finds his father lying bleeding. He gets his father to a hospital and returns to Griffin to ask for help. Realizing Roland is personally hunting David, Griffin agrees.They go to pick Millie up at the airport, but she is no longer there. Griffin returns to his hideout to get weapons. David breaks into Millie's apartment, angering her. Seeing Roland arriving, David decides to reveal the truth to her. He teleports her to Griffin's hideout. Using a machine that keeps David's \"jump scar\" open, the Paladins, including Roland, invade the hideout. David and Griffin subdue most of them. Roland is chased back through the jump scar, but he manages to snatch Millie with him. He sets up a trap in Millie's apartment, expecting David to come back for her.Obsessed with killing Roland, Griffin plans to bomb the apartment; but David objects, wanting to save Millie. They fight and David traps Griffin with power lines in Chechnya. Ignoring Griffin's warning, David jumps to Millie's apartment and is quickly trapped by Roland's cables. The cables \"link\" him to the apartment, making him unable to jump away alone. Mustering his strength, David teleports the apartment and everyone inside to a river. Once free of the cables, David teleports Millie to safety and dumps Roland in a cave in the Grand Canyon. He leaves Roland there, explaining that not all Jumpers are a threat to be destroyed.David visits his mother and discovers his half-sister, Sophie (Kristen Stewart).

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   BACKGROUND: A proposed revision of sepsis definitions has abandoned the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), defined organ dysfunction as an increase in total Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score of ≥ 2, and conceived “qSOFA” (quick SOFA) as a bedside indicator of organ dysfunction. We aimed to (1) determine the prognostic impact of SIRS, (2) compare the diagnostic accuracy of SIRS and qSOFA for organ dysfunction, and (3) compare standard (Sepsis‐2) and revised (Sepsis‐3) definitions for organ dysfunction in ED patients with infection.  METHODS: Consecutive ED patients admitted with presumed infection were prospectively enrolled over 3 years. Sufficient observational data were collected to calculate SIRS, qSOFA, SOFA, comorbidity, and mortality.  RESULTS: We enrolled 8,871 patients, with SIRS present in 4,176 (47.1%). SIRS was associated with increased risk of organ dysfunction (relative risk [RR] 3.5) and mortality in patients without organ dysfunction (OR 3.2). SIRS and qSOFA showed similar discrimination for organ dysfunction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72 vs 0.73). qSOFA was specific but poorly sensitive for organ dysfunction (96.1% and 29.7%, respectively). Mortality for patients with organ dysfunction was similar for Sepsis‐2 and Sepsis‐3 (12.5% and 11.4%, respectively), although 29% of patients with Sepsis‐3 organ dysfunction did not meet Sepsis‐2 criteria. Increasing numbers of Sepsis‐2 organ system dysfunctions were associated with greater mortality.  CONCLUSIONS: SIRS was associated with organ dysfunction and mortality, and abandoning the concept appears premature. A qSOFA score ≥ 2 showed high specificity, but poor sensitivity may limit utility as a bedside screening method. Although mortality for organ dysfunction was comparable between Sepsis‐2 and Sepsis‐3, more prognostic and clinical information is conveyed using Sepsis‐2 regarding number and type of organ dysfunctions. The SOFA score may require recalibration.", "answer": "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Quick Sequential Organ Function Assessment, and Organ Dysfunction: Insights From a Prospective Database of ED Patients With Infection"}

{"question": "Title: Charles Haley Background: Charles Lewis Haley (born January 6, 1964) is a former American football linebacker and defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers (1986-1991, 1998-1999) and the Dallas Cowboys (1992-1996). A versatile defensive player, Haley began his career as a specialty outside linebacker, eventually progressing to pass-rusher and finally full-fledged defensive end. He is the first five-time Super Bowl champion, and is one of only two such players, the other being Tom Brady. He won two Super Bowls with the 49ers (XXIII, XXIV) and three with the Cowboys (XXVII, XXVIII, XXX); he was a starter in all five championship games. Section: Dallas Cowboys Passage: In 1992, Haley was moved to right defensive end in the Dallas Cowboys 4-3 defense, made 39 tackles, 6 sacks, and 42 quarterback pressures (led the team), and helped the team improve from 17th in total defense in 1991 to first. Haley received the UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year Award and was a consensus All-Pro once again. He is often mentioned as the final piece that helped propel the Cowboys into a Super Bowl contender.  In 1993, Haley made headlines after smashing his helmet through a wall in the locker room following a home loss to the Buffalo Bills, showing his displeasure with the team's inability to sign holdout running back Emmitt Smith, which contributed to an 0-2 start and put the season in jeopardy. The Cowboys relented and reached an agreement with Smith the following week, getting them back on track and making them the first team to win a Super Bowl after starting a season 0-2. He registered 41 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 passes defensed, and 3 forced fumbles, but his recurring back problems began to require a series of surgeries.  In 1994, Haley recovered from off-season surgery (lumbar microdiscectomy) to post 68 tackles, 12.5 sacks, and 52 quarterback pressures. He immediately announced his retirement after losing 28-38 to the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, but decided to return after being offered a new contract.  In 1995, Haley posted 10.5 sacks, 33 quarterback pressures, and 35 tackles in the first 10 games, until suffering a ruptured disk against the Washington Redskins, which derailed his season. He started in Super Bowl XXX six weeks after having back surgery, making one sack, 3 quarterback pressures and 5 tackles. The next year, with the team trying to limit him to 30 plays per game, he appeared in the first three contests, in week 9 and 10, before being deactivated with a back injury. He retired after the season, because of his back injuries and his youngest daughter Brianna having been diagnosed with leukemia.

{"question": "Studies in restaurants show that the tips left by customers who pay their bill in cash tend to be larger when the bill is presented on a tray that bears a credit card logo.

A: The percentage of restaurant bills paid with a given brand of credit card increases when that credit card's logo is displayed on the tray with which the bill is presented. B: In general, restaurant patrons who pay their bills in cash leave larger tips than do those who pay by credit card. C: Patrons who are under financial pressure from their credit-card obligations tend to tip less when presented with a restaurant bill on a tray with a credit-card logo than when the tray has no logo.

{"question": "Title: Gavin Newsom Background: Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (nee Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for Getty Oil. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. Section: Mayoralty Passage: As mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, in violation of the state law passed in 2000.  Implementation of Care Not Cash began on July 1, 2004. As part of his Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.  In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow communities in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.  In 2009, Newsom came under attack for the City of San Francisco's policy of illegally harboring juvenile criminal aliens. A sanctuary city, San Francisco had long been circumventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by harboring or sending the aliens back to their own native countries.  In 2009, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. In 2008, he had hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food, and he secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus. In 2010, Newsom was named \"America's Most Social Mayor\" by Samepoint, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors from the 100 largest cities in the United States. That same year, Newsom was removed from the San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, because, according to SFCDCC chairman Aaron Peskin, Newsom no longer resided in the city. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What city is Gavin Newsom mayor of? Answer: He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. Question: What is the name of Newsom's company? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: What was one of Newsom's biggest accomplishments as mayor?

{"question": "Title: Mr. Tambourine Man Background: \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" is a song written, composed, and performed by Bob Dylan, who released his original version of it on his 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home. The Byrds also recorded a version of the song that they released in the same year as their first single on Columbia Records, reaching number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, as well as being the title track of their debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The Byrds' recording of the song was influential in popularizing the musical subgenres of folk rock and jangle pop, leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single's success. Section: Interpretations Passage: William Ruhlmann, writing for the AllMusic Web site, has suggested the following interpretation of the song's lyrics: \"The time seems to be early morning following a night when the narrator has not slept. Still unable to sleep, though amazed by his weariness, he is available and open to Mr. Tambourine Man's song, and says he will follow him. In the course of four verses studded with internal rhymes, he expounds on this situation, his meaning often heavily embroidered with imagery, though the desire to be freed by the tambourine man's song remains clear.\"  While there has been speculation that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana, particularly with lines such as \"take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship\" and \"the smoke rings of my mind\", Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs. Though he was using marijuana at the time the song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or muse, or the singer's search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book Like a Complete Unknown that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.  Dylan has cited the influence of Federico Fellini's movie La Strada on the song, while other commentators have found echoes of the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. Author Howard Sounes has identified the lyrics \"in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you\" as having been taken from a Lord Buckley recording. Bruce Langhorne, who performs guitar on the track, has been cited by Dylan as the inspiration for the tambourine man image in the song. Langhorne used to play a giant, four-inch-deep \"tambourine\" (actually a Turkish frame drum), and had brought the instrument to a previous Dylan recording session. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What is being interpreted? Answer: Mr. Tambourine Man's Question: Was the song Mr. Tambourine Man recorded by other artists? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: How many versions of the song did dylan do? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Was there a message that dylan was trying to convey with the song? Answer: there has been speculation that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana, Question: Was there a muse or a mentor that inspired the song? Answer: a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Question: So it might be considered a religious song?", "answer": "The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation."}

{"question": "Article: Sacked: Former Greenwich tourism chief Neil McCollum joked about crime in the borough . A tourism boss who slated an area he was paid £60,000 a year to promote has been sacked after a three month probe into his comments. Neil McCollum was head of tourism for the London borough of Greenwich and responsible for the area's Olympic welcome strategy when he branded a nearby district 'unsafe' in a Twitter rant earlier this year. His internet comments caused an outcry and despite having them removed from his account a blogger spread them sparking outrage. Mr McCollum tweeted: 'Guest appearance in Woolwich today.  Wonder if it has changed. 'Mental note: Make sure wallet is not visible!' The area is understood to have issues with low-level crime and has undergone several redevelopments. Residents in the South East London borough quickly complained about Mr McCollum's jibe and the message was removed from his Twitter account. After a three-month investigation, Greenwich Council chiefs have now dismissed Mr McCollum from his post. Incriminating: Mr McCollum's facetious Twitter message, which backfired . Mr McCollum, who lives in Whitstable, Kent, had also been in charge of Greenwich's Olympic welcome strategy. Greenwich is hosting equestrian and shooting events next year. Several residents backed the council's decision with messages posted on the internet. One wrote: 'Regardless of the truth that Woolwich has a crime problem, his job was to paint the whole borough in the best possible light and in that he failed.' But others criticised the council. One message said: 'He's an idiot for posting every thought that pops into his head on Twitter but what he said is correct.' Another added: 'This shows how we allow political correctness to take priority over honesty and common sense.' Greenwich council confirmed a tourism officer had been dismissed. Redevelopment: Woolwich has suffered with low-level crime in the past but it is being modernised . A council spokesman said he had lost his job for 'breaching our code of conduct and bringing the authority into disrepute.' The spokesman added: 'The reason for this dismissal is that the individual brought the council into disrepute and breached the council’s rules of conduct.

Band members are Nathan Willett (vocals, piano, guitar), Matt Maust (bass guitar), David Quon (guitar, backing vocals), Matthew Schwartz (backing vocals, keyboards and piano, percussion, guitar), and Joe Plummer (drums, percussion). Former members of the band include Dann Gallucci (guitar, keyboards, percussion), Matt Aveiro (drums, percussion), and Jonnie Russell (guitar, vocals, piano, keyboards, percussion). Forming in 2004 in Fullerton California, the Cold War Kids' early releases came from independent record label Monarchy Music.

On January 15, 2013, the band announced a new single, \"Miracle Mile\", for their fourth album, Dear Miss Lonelyhearts. The latter was released on April 2, 2013. They followed that up with an EP titled Tuxedos, released on September 17, 2013. They promoted both efforts with a U.S. headline tour that ended on November 6, 2013. In November 2013, they announced that a fifth album was in the works. On November 10, 2013, the Orange County Register reported that drummer Matt Aveiro had left the band, and that Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer would be holding his place indefinitely.  In March 2014, Cold War Kids collaborated with Belgian brewer Stella Artois and sonic inventor Andy Cavatorta for a project titled \"Chalice Symphony\" that involved using the brewer's famous drinking glasses as instruments for the band to use to record the track \"A Million Eyes\". The behind-the-scenes videos were used as commercials and were uploaded on the brewer's YouTube page. The song was released on iTunes on March 3, 2014, and the music video that went along with the track premiered on YouTube on April 4, 2014.

On July 15, 2014, Cold War Kids released the first single, \"All This Could Be Yours\", from their fifth album Hold My Home, which was released on October 21. The release of Hold My Home had drummer Joe Plummer and multi-instrumentalist/singer Matthew Schwartz being credited as proper members of the band on the album's liner notes as opposed to touring members as previously credited. The album also spawned the single \"First\" in February 2015.

{"question": "Title: Thomas A. Hendricks Background: Thomas Andrews Hendricks (September 7, 1819 - November 25, 1885) was an American politician and lawyer from Indiana who served as the 16th Governor of Indiana (1873-77) and the 21st Vice President of the United States (1885). Hendricks represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives (1851-55) and the U.S. Senate (1863-69). He also represented Shelby County, Indiana, in the Indiana General Assembly (1848-50) and as a delegate to the 1851 Indiana constitutional convention. In addition, Hendricks served as commissioner of the General Land Office (1855-59). Section: Governor of Indiana Passage: In 1872 Hendricks was elected as the governor of Indiana in his third bid for the office. An indication of Hendricks's growing national popularity occurred during the presidential election of 1872; the Democrats nominated Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican candidate. Greeley died soon after the election, but before the Electoral College cast its ballots; 42 of 63 Democratic electors previously pledged to Greeley voted for Hendricks.  Hendricks served as governor of Indiana from January 13, 1873 to January 8, 1877, a difficult period of post-war economic depression following the financial Panic of 1873. Indiana experienced high unemployment, business failures, labor strikes, and falling farm prices. Hendricks twice called out the state militia to end workers' strikes, one by miners in Clay County, and one by railroad workers' in Logansport.  Although Hendricks succeeded in encouraging legislation enacting election and judiciary reform, the Republican-controlled legislature prevented him from achieving many of his other legislative goals. In 1873 Hendricks signed the Baxter bill, a controversial piece of temperance legislation that established a strict form of local option, even though he personally had favored a licensing law. Hendricks signed the legislation because he thought the bill was constitutional and reflected the majority view of the Indiana General Assembly and the will of Indiana's citizens. The law proved to be unenforceable and was repealed in 1875; it was replaced by a licensing system that Hendricks had preferred.  One of Hendricks's lasting legacies during his tenure as governor began with discussion to fund construction of a new Indiana Statehouse. The existing structure, which had been in use since 1835, had become too small, forcing the growing state government to rent additional buildings around Indianapolis. Besides its size, the dilapidated capitol building was in need of major repair. The roof in the Hall of Representatives had collapsed in 1867 and public inspectors condemned the building in 1873. The cornerstone for the present-day state capital building was laid in 1880, after Hendricks left office, and he delivered the keynote speech at the ceremony. The new statehouse was completed eight years later and remains in use as Indiana's state capitol building. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did he become Govenor? Answer: In 1872 Hendricks was elected as the governor of Indiana in his third bid for the office. Question: He ran for govenor before?

I worked for a company for 4 years and for the last two years reported to a VP of Finance. I left the company because I received an external offer and they decided not to counter offer.  It’s now been about 4 months since I left and I got a LinkedIn message from my old boss along the lines of “would you be willing to have a call with your replacement who was just hired to give them some pointers and advice related to the role?”  I am of course flattered that he thinks well enough of me to reach out and my personality disposition is always to be helpful to others. However I’m also no longer an employee of the company and have moved on to a totally different industry.   Some random INFO which might help:  I’m a little salty about the whole situation. I put in a lot of 70 hours weeks and played a key role in growing the team and business. On my end it was a bad breakup overall.   When I provided the outside offer I mentioned both my manager and the division president I wanted to stay and even suggested multiple options for them to counter-offer.   A division President from a sister organization offered to co-fund my headcount to keep me from leaving and my Management simply outright declined.

Angel was raised in Elmont until fourth grade, when his family moved to East Meadow, New York. His father, John Sarantakos, owned a restaurant and doughnut shop. Section: Television specials and promotional appearances (2002-2005) Passage: On October 20, 2002, Angel performed in the ABC Family television special named Criss Angel Mindfreak: Postmodern illusionist, an hour-long performance and tribute to Harry Houdini. The special aired again on December 24, 2002 on Channel 4 in the UK. The Birmingham Evening Mail reviewed the show, writing, \"Criss Angel is currently making a name for himself as a more provocative, darker alternative to [other illusionists]. He walks the streets of New York, hypnotising passers-by, turning cups of take-away coffee into cockroaches and suspending himself from the ceiling by inserting hooks into his back. The piece de resistance of all these mind games is an update of the Houdini underwater trick - an attempt to stay in a (cell) tank of water for 24 hours, padlocked and restrained. All seems to be going well, until the filter system breaks down and the water begins to heat up.\"  On October 31, 2003 SciFi Channel aired the one-hour special Supernatural starring Angel. Kate O'Hare said of the special that, \"Filmed in part at Universal Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., \"Supernatural\" finds Angel crawling up buildings, passing a quarter through his skin, spontaneously combusting and having otherworldly creatures burst from his chest.\" When asked about his process in creating television specials, Angel said that, \"I like to have my hand in everything on my TV specials. I'm the executive producer; I direct it; I create it. I write all the music for my TV specials and my live performances. It's on my label. I write it; I produce it.\" During the special Angel performed stunts including lighting himself on fire and making a tarantula emerge from a pedestrian's soda can. In 2003, Angel was also featured in the two-hour TBS special Made in Japan.  In early 2003, Angel performed at the release of the new branding for Miller Lite beer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the 80th anniversary of Houdini's last performance in that city. For the performance, he was suspended ten stories in the air and bound in a straitjacket, from which he escaped. He also performed an illusion at Ozzfest in 2005.

{"question": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words.   By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website The scientists successfully rid 37 pigs of viruses hiding in their DNA, overcoming one of the big barriers to transplanting pig organs to people. The team at eGenesis admits preventing pig organs from being rejected by the human body remains a huge challenge But experts said it was a promising and exciting first step. The study, published in the journal Science, started with skin cells from a pig. Tests identified 25 Pervs - porcine endogenous retroviruses - hidden in the pig's genetic code. Experiments mixing human and pig cells together showed those viruses could escape to infect human tissues. But the researchers then used the game-changing gene-editing technology Crispr to delete the 25 Pervs. It then took cloning technology, the same used to create Dolly the sheep, to place the genetic material from those cells into a pig's egg and create embryos. The complex process is inefficient, but 37 healthy piglets have been born. \"These are the first Perv-free pigs,\" Dr Luhan Yang, one of the researchers from Harvard University and the spinout company eGenesis, told the BBC News website. They were also \"the most genetically modified [animals] in terms of the number of modifications\", he said. If xenotransplantation - using organs from other species - works, then it has the potential to alleviate long waits for a transplant. More than 100,000 people need an organ transplant in the US. There are about 6,500 people on the UK waiting list. Dr Yang told the BBC: \"We recognise we are still at the early stages of research and development. \"We know we have an audacious vision of a world with no shortage of organs, that is very challenging, but that is also our motivation to remove mountains.\" Pigs are particularly promising for xenotransplantation as their organs are a similar size to humans', and the animals can be bred in large numbers. But removing the viruses is only half the challenge, even organs donated from other people can cause a strong immune reaction that leads to the transplant being rejected. The US team is investigating further genetic modifications to make pig organs more acceptable to the human immune system. First step Darren Griffin, a genetics professor at the University of Kent, said: \"This represents a significant step forward towards the possibility of making xenotransplantation a reality. \"However, there are so many variables, including ethical issues, to resolve before xenotransplantation can take place.\" Prof Ian McConnell, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"This work provides a promising first step in the development of genetic strategies for creating strains of pigs where the risk of transmission of retroviruses has been eliminated. \"It remains to be seen whether these results can be translated into a fully safe strategy in organ transplantation.\" The researchers had to overcome unexpected challenges from performing so much gene-editing in one go. The Crispr technology works like a combination of a sat-nav and a pair of scissors. The sat-nav finds the right spot in the genetic code, and then the scissors perform the cut. But making 25 cuts throughout the pig's genome led to DNA instability and the loss of genetic information. Follow James on Twitter.", "answer": "GM pigs take step to being organ donors"}

The intracellular Ca(2+) concentration of many nonexcitable cells is regulated by calcium store release and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). In platelets, STIM1 was recently identified as the main calcium sensor expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. To evaluate the role of the SOC channel moiety, Orai1, in platelet SOCE, we generated mice expressing a mutated, inactive form of Orai1 in blood cells only (Orai1(R93W)). Platelets expressing Orai1(R93W) were characterized by markedly reduced SOCE and impaired agonist-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i). Orai1(R93W) platelets showed reduced integrin activation and impaired degranulation when stimulated with low agonist concentrations under static conditions. This defect, however, did not significantly affect the ability of Orai1(R93W) platelets to aggregate or to adhere to collagen under arterial flow conditions ex vivo. In contrast, these adherent Orai1(R93W) platelets were defective in surface phosphatidylserine exposure, suggesting that Orai1 is crucial for the platelets' procoagulant response rather than for other Ca(2+)-dependent cellular responses.", "answer": "R93W mutation in Orai1 causes impaired calcium influx in platelets."}

The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.   Premise: A man touches the snow as he snowboards downhill. Hypothesis: The man is snowboarding a black diamond trail. Update: There is a large steep drop off to the right of the snowboarder that goes down the mountain", "answer": "strengthener"}

{"question": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage. Answering these questions, typically involve understanding multiple sentences. Make sure that your answer has the same type as the \"answer type\" mentioned in input. The provided \"answer type\" can be of any of the following types: \"span\", \"date\", \"number\". A \"span\" answer is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. You can directly copy-paste the text from the passage or the question for span type answers. If you find multiple spans, please add them all as a comma separated list. Please restrict each span to five words. A \"number\" type answer can include a digit specifying an actual value. For \"date\" type answers, use DD MM YYYY format e.g. 11 Jan 1992. If full date is not available in the passage you can write partial date such as 1992 or Jan 1992. If you find multiple spans, please add them all as a comma separated list. Please restrict each span to five words.   Passage: In the meantime, some Bulgarian leaders tried to negotiate the establishment of a Bulgarian Uniate Church. The movement for union with Rome led to the initial recognition of a separate Bulgarian Catholic Millet by the Sultan in 1860. The Sultan issued a special decree  for that occasion. Although the movement initially gathered some 60,000 adherents, the subsequent establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate reduced their number with some 75%. The Bulgarian \"Church Struggle\" was resolved finally with a Sultan decree in 1870, which established the Bulgarian Exarchate.  The act also instituted the Bulgarian Orthodox Millet - an entity combining the modern notion for a nation with the Ottoman principle of Millet. It also turned the Bulgarian Exarch into both a religious leader and an administrative head of the Millet. The new entity enjoyed internal cultural and administrative autonomy. However, it excluded non-Orthodox Bulgarians and, thus, failed to embrace all representatives of the Bulgarian ethnos. Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the Bulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians. On 11 May 1872 in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, the Bulgarian hierarchs, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church was declared. The decision on the unilateral declaration of autocephaly by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In this way, the term phyletism was coined at the Holy pan-Orthodox Synod that met in Istanbul on 10 August. The Synod issued an official condemnation of  ecclesiastical nationalism, and declared on 18 September the  Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic.  Question: How many days after the Synod met in August did they issue the Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic?  Answer type: Number", "answer": "39."}

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.   It is well-known that deeper neural networks are harder to train than shallower ones. In this short paper, we use the (full) eigenvalue spectrum of the Hessian to explore how the loss landscape changes as the network gets deeper, and as residual connections are added to the architecture. Computing a series of quantitative measures on the Hessian spectrum, we show that the Hessian eigenvalue distribution in deeper networks has substantially heavier tails (equivalently, more outlier eigenvalues), which makes the network harder to optimize with first-order methods. We show that adding residual connections mitigates this effect substantially, suggesting a mechanism by which residual connections improve training.", "answer": "Network depth increases outlier eigenvalues in the Hessian.

{"question": "Title: Anil Kumble Background: Anil Kumble ( pronunciation  born 17 October 1970) is an Indian former cricketer and a former captain of Tests and ODIs, who played Tests and ODIs for 18 years. A right-arm leg spin (leg break googly) bowler, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and remains the third-highest wicket taker of all time (as of 2018, behind Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne). Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, but relied primarily on pace, bounce, and accuracy. Section: IPL career Passage: Kumble agreed to honour his contract with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise of the Indian Premier League after retirement. He was given a three-year contract worth US$500,000 per year in the first round of bidding in 2008.  On 18 April 2009 he took a five-wicket haul conceding just 5 runs against the defending champions Rajasthan Royals, which helped RCB get a 75-run victory in the second match of the 2009 edition, played in South Africa. After the departure of Kevin Pietersen for England's cricket commitments, Kumble was named as the captain of the Royal Challengers. On 23 May 2009 his team defeated the Chennai Super Kings by six wickets and got a spot in the final against the Deccan Chargers. Though RCB could not win the tournament, Kumble ended as the most successful spin bowler and the 2nd highest wicket-taker of the tournament with 21 wickets at an economy rate of 5.86 runs per over behind R. P. Singh.  In 2010 Indian Premier League, Kumble led the team to the semi-finals. After being forced to play their semi-finals at the DY Patil Stadium following security concerns in Bangalore, the Royal Challengers lost their semi-final to the Mumbai Indians with Kumble taking 1 wicket at an economy rate of 7.50 in the match.  Kumble announced his retirement from Indian Premier League on 4 January 2011. After his retirement from IPL as a player, RCB appointed him as the chief mentor for the team.

Me=me, GF=My dads girlfriend, Dad=D, Her little brother= LB  So some background, I (14M) met my dads (45M) girlfriend (26F, I know it’s weird) about a year ago. She’s a typical 20 something girl, for example she’s basically given everything to her when asked and also connected to Internet and instagram 24/7. She also wants all the expensive stuff like, Gucci, Louis V, iPhone XS Max, AirPods, etc. She also has a little brother who is 8 and he keeps me entertained.   Also, she can be a real bitchy person when pissed off and she gets pissed off easily. My dad can also be “hard headed” but not all the time. So when they argue it’s a real big fight. I’ve seen this happen and it’s caused her to move out two times back to her moms. My dads been through her shit enough times to where he knows just to sometimes leave it alone and that’s what he told me today. It’s kinda annoying to see them argue when I see them do.   I’ve never really had a problem until today. So we were flying from Puerto Rico back home. It’s Me, GF, D, LB and his mom. Now, we had a layover coming back. Now keep in mind all of us have barley eaten except for maybe one meal.   So while waiting for the next flight we sit at little place while charging our phones and I order these meatballs and LBs mom gets him Cheezits. When it comes it’s just 4 regular sized meatballs. Now I won’t be eating for about 4 more hours that’s a long time for a growing teen like me. LB also looked interested in my food and then his mom goes you can’t have any of his food, I’ll get you some if you really want some. Then GF comes over.   GF: Can &lt;her little brothers name&gt; have a meatball?  Me: No, it’s going to be...  And before I got time to explain she walks away. Now I was raised as single child and taught to share pretty good and so I would’ve usually but they could always buy him his own if he wanted.   She went back to her phone while I finished eating and then go to the restroom before it’s time to board and my dad pulls me aside.   D: &lt;GFs name&gt; is pissed off because you didn’t give &lt;little bros name&gt; a meatball.   Me: Oh. Well we won’t be eating for awhile and I haven’t eaten all day.   D: I know but I was going to tell you we could order more food.   Me: Oh I’m sorry I didn’t know.   D: Just...don’t say anything.   Then we go back and by then they ordered him some meatballs.   Then we have our tickets and it’s spilt up 2 and 3 like the last couple of flights and it’s usually: GF on window, D in middle, Me on middle and little bro and his mom on the other side but this time she wants it to be me and my dad and the rest while obviously pissed off. I see my dad texting her while we are sitting and she said   “I just can’t get over it. Sorry.” So I asked my dad   Me: “Did I piss her off?”  D: “She’s always pissed off. *Sigh*”   Now I’m writing this as we fly.   Sorry it was long I just wanted to know your guys opinions.", "answer": "not giving my dads girlfriends little brother a meatball"}

A firefighter who was dressed in a bear costume at a carnival was badly injured when he was run over by his own colleagues. Justin Matthews, a retained firefighter from Torrington, Devon, was walking in front of the vehicle during the town's carnival when he was hit by its front wheel. Mr Matthews, who is the landlord at the Cavalier Inn in Well Street in Torrington, was dressed in a bear costume at the time. Justin Matthews was dressed as a bear as he followed the town's annual carnival when he was hit by the truck . The firefighters foot became trapped under the front offside wheel. He is believed to have broken the tibia in his left leg . The incident happened as the carnival was making its way around the roundabout next to Torrington Cottage Hospital at the top of Calf Street at around 7pm on Saturday night. The procession was stopped while ambulances treated the firefighter, who has broken his tibia, at the scene. Ellen Vernon, who lives in Torrington, said the crowd was horrified as everyone realised what had happened. 'I was sat on the roundabout as he came around the corner,' she said. 'The fire engine had several people walking in front of it. 'There was a guy on stilts or in some tall costume and another dressed as a bear. 'The fire engine was turning very slowly around the roundabout to back up towards Calf Street. 'As it turned, the bear was walking on the inside of the roundabout and it appears the front wheel caught him. Mr Matthews, who is a retained firefighter, was walking in front of the fire engine when he got caught up in the wheel of the vehicle . 'The bloke who had been hit starting screaming \"back up, back up\". Because he had the bear head on I think he had not seen or heard the fire engine. 'It was a scene of horror. There were lots of families and children thinking 'oh my god' when they realised what had happened. 'A lady ran out from the crowd who was medical in some form or another and helped. The carnival was stopped for half an hour or so while the ambulance crew gave him oxygen.' Mr Matthews was taken to North Devon District Hospital but came home again later that evening. Graham Rooke, from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was a low-speed incident. He was wearing a bear suit and walking in front of the fire engine. 'His foot became trapped under the front offside wheel. 'He has broken his tibia in his left leg and his foot is swollen but other than that we don't think there are any other injuries. It just shows accidents can happen to anyone - even the emergency services aren't immune. 'A full investigation will now be undertaken to determine what the cause was and to stop it happening again.'

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market.

{"question": "Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.   This past 4th of July was the first of my grand daughters life. We had her come over to our house where it is legal to shoot off fireworks and basically celebrate however you decide to do that. We started off the day by cooking up some food and having a nice cookout on this day. We had some burgers and some typical 4th of July foods. We spent the day together as a family really just having a nice time together talking and catching up. Then it started to get darker outside and we began to shoot off some fireworks. All of our neighbors also take part in this as there really is a fireworks show right above our house. We took her outside and at first she acted a bit scared because of all the noise. After a little bit though she relaxed and began to enjoy seeing all of the lights in the sky and hearing the noise. She was really having a great time seeing all of these things for the very first time and it reminded me how much something like this can mean. It took me back and made me enjoy the 4th more than I have in a long time. I really enjoyed watching how she reacted to each huge firework that exploded in the sky above her head. She was throwing her hands in the air and screaming in joy about how much fun she was having with all of this. We really had a great time on this 4th showing this little girl what this holiday was all about. She had a great experience with the entire thing and really enjoyed her first one. She couldn't stop smiling as she was having the time of her life during this event.", "answer": "retold"}

{"question": "Suppose a convex 3d-object has k pentagonal faces and m hexagonal faces. All faces are regular. What is k? Relevant Theorem: Euler's Theory in graph theory is a collection of concepts and results related to the properties of graphs, specifically focusing on the existence of Eulerian circuits and paths. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who first introduced these ideas in the 18th century while studying the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem.  In graph theory, a graph is a collection of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or connections) between these vertices. An Eulerian circuit is a closed walk in a graph that traverses each edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. An Eulerian path is a walk that traverses each edge exactly once but does not necessarily return to the starting vertex.  Euler's Theory provides criteria for determining whether a graph has an Eulerian circuit or path:  1. A connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has an even degree (i.e., an even number of edges are incident to the vertex). This is known as the Euler's Circuit Theorem.  2. A connected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if exactly two vertices have an odd degree (i.e., an odd number of edges are incident to the vertex). In this case, the Eulerian path must start at one of these odd-degree vertices and end at the other.  Some key concepts and results related to Euler's Theory include:  - Fleury's Algorithm: A method for constructing an Eulerian circuit or path in a graph that satisfies the necessary conditions.  - Hierholzer's Algorithm: Another method for finding Eulerian circuits, which is more efficient than Fleury's Algorithm.  - Semi-Eulerian Graph: A connected graph that has an Eulerian path but not an Eulerian circuit.  - Eulerization: The process of adding edges to a graph to make it Eulerian, typically by duplicating existing edges to ensure all vertices have even degrees.  Euler's Theory laid the foundation for graph theory as a mathematical discipline and has applications in various fields, including computer science, network analysis, and operations research.", "answer": "12"}

{"question": "Title: Ben Carson Background: Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr. (born September 18, 1951) is an American neurosurgeon, author and politician serving as the 17th and current United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development since 2017, under the Trump Administration. Prior to his cabinet position, he was a candidate for President of the United States in the Republican primaries in 2016. Born in Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School, Carson has authored numerous books on his medical career and political stances. Section: Tenure Passage: On March 6, his first day as secretary, while addressing Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employees, Carson saluted the work ethic of immigrants, and during his comments appeared to compare slaves to voluntary immigrants. A HUD spokesman said that no one present thought Carson \"was equating voluntary immigration with involuntary servitude.\" In the same speech, Carson inaccurately said that the human brain \"was incapable of forgetting and could be electrically stimulated into perfect recall.\"  Under the federal budget proposed by Trump in 2017, HUD's budget for fiscal year 2018 would be cut by $6.2 billion (13%) and the Community Development Block Grant, a program which Carson praised in a trip to Detroit as HUD secretary, would be eliminated. Carson issued a statement supporting the proposed cuts. Carson suggested that federal funds for housing in Detroit could be part of an expected infrastructure bill.  On April 2017, while speaking in Washington at the National Low Income Housing Coalition conference, Carson said that housing funding would be including in an upcoming infrastructure bill from the Trump administration.  In July 2017, during his keynote address at the LeadingAge Florida annual convention, Carson stated his concern about \"seniors who become destitute\" and reported that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had increased public housing programs for the elderly by an unspecified number.  In the summer 2017, Carson allowed his son, a Baltimore businessman Ben Carson Jr., to participate in organizing a HUD \"listening tour\" in Baltimore. Internal documents obtained by the Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act showed that the younger Carson \"put people he'd invited in touch with his father's deputies, joined agency staff on official conference calls about the listening tour and copied his wife on related email exchanges.\" The son's involvement prompted HUD staff to express concern; the department's deputy general counsel for operations wrote in a memorandum \"that this gave the appearance that the Secretary may be using his position for his son's private gain.\" Carson's wife, son, and daughter-in-law also attended official meetings. In February 2018, the HUD inspector general's office confirmed that it was looking into the role that Carson's family played at the department.

{"question": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.   Abstract: Abnormal left ventricular diastolic performance, an early manifestation of hypertension in the heart, may precede the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. To assess effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart, left ventricular mass (determined by echocardiography) and rapid left ventricular filling rate (determined by radionuclide ventriculography) were compared before and after 6 months of treatment of 16 patients. Nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) was given alone or in combination with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, and significantly reduced blood pressure (156/103 +/- 12/7 to 137/89 +/- 10/6 mm Hg). In 6 of the 16 patients, left ventricular mass decreased by more than 10% (270 +/- 95 to 193 +/- 47 g, p less than 0.01); in the same patients, left ventricular filling rate increased (2.03 +/- 0.35 to 2.30 +/- 0.45 end-diastolic counts/s [EDC/s], p less than 0.01). In the one patient whose left ventricular mass increased (137 to 195 g), left ventricular filling rate decreased from 2.01 to 1.78 EDC/s. In the remaining nine patients who had no change in left ventricular mass, there was no significant changes in left ventricular filling. The changes in ventricular mass and filling could not be related to the extent of change in blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that regression of left ventricular mass during antihypertensive therapy with nitrendipine is accompanied by improved diastolic function.", "answer": "Improved left ventricular filling accompanies reduced left ventricular mass during therapy of essential hypertension."}

{"question": "Title: Dinosaur Jr. Background: Dinosaur Jr. is an American rock band formed in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1984, originally simply called Dinosaur until legal issues forced a change in name. The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels earned the band a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock, creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson came aboard for three major-label albums. Section: Formation Passage: Mascis and Barlow played together, on drums and guitar respectively, in the hardcore punk band Deep Wound, formed in 1982 while the pair were attending high school in western Massachusetts. After high school, they began exploring slower yet still aggressive music such as Black Sabbath, the Replacements, and Neil Young. Mascis' college friend Gerard Cosloy introduced him to psychedelic-influenced pop bands like Dream Syndicate, which Mascis in turn showed to Barlow. Barlow explained, \"We loved speed metal...and we loved wimpy-jangly stuff\".  Deep Wound broke up in mid-1984. Cosloy had dropped out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to focus on running his independent record label, Homestead Records, and promised Mascis that if he were to make a record Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. Barlow said the songs \"were fucking brilliant...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like 'I'm so sad.' While I was really into my own little tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama.\" Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy, otherwise known as Murph, to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as \"ear-bleeding country\".  The band was initially named Mogo, and played their first show on University of Massachusetts Amherst campus in the first week of September 1984. However, Nakajima used the performance to launch an extended anti-police tirade. Mascis was so appalled by Nakajima's behavior at the show that he disbanded the group the next day. A few days later Mascis invited Barlow and Murph to form a new band without telling Nakajima. \"I was kind of too wimpy to kick him out, exactly,\" Mascis later admitted. \"Communicating with people has been a constant problem in the band.\" The trio named themselves Dinosaur, and Mascis and Barlow took over lead-vocal duties. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did the band form? Answer: September 1984. Question: What was significant about the formation?

The standard: on mobile so formatting or autocorrect may be wrong. And TL;DR at the bottom.    So, a bit of background to this. I currently live with my girlfriend and she's expecting our daughter in a couple of months. So before I get into it, I KNOW smoking is bad for me and a baby (not to mention anyone else) so spare me the lecture, I'm not an idiot - I don't smoke indoors and I always use peppermint oil to mask the smell (trust me, it does mask it, my girfriend has admitted it) so I'm not an intrusive smoker. I'm respectful and I try not to let this affect anyone else's life. She's mentioned previously that this is NOT an issue in the relationship one little bit. We regularly joke that I'm almost a 'secret smoke' as I often completely disappear, have a cig and then come back smelling of peppermint.   Anyway, I normally come home from work at about 7pm and need to have a cigarette after a stressful day, it helps me relax. My girlfriend knows my routine and she goes about this unaffected normally.   Today however, she gives me a hug as normal when I get in and, without me knowing, goes into my pocket and steals the cigarette packet out of my jacket pocket. I'm a man of habit so they're always in the same pocket. She goes into the bedroom and I pour myself a drink of water in the kitchen.   Anyway, I reach into my pocket so that I can get a cigarette out and go for a smoke. Of course, I couldn't find them. I KNEW they were there when I was walking from my train as I always check whenever I get off the train and do the 'four pocket tap': phone, wallet, keys and cigarettes. Next minute, my gf comes down with a wry smile on her face and says \"you'll have to find them\".   At this point I get pissed, in the infancy of our relationship, she used to do this ALL THE TIME but after many times of telling her that it wasn't funny because it stresses me out, she stopped. However, for whatever reason she decided it would be funny to do today. No idea why.   Now, I'm visibly getting stressed and I go upstairs to try and find them and couldn't. Obviously I'm mad at this point because I hate people ruining my routine, even little things like this (I know it's stupid, but she knows this). I see her phone on the bed side table and hide it on the top of my wardrobe (out of her reach). She eventually comes upstairs for her phone. She asks if I've seen it and this is how the convo goes:   Me: yeah I've seen it. I'll tell you where it is when you tell me where my cigarettes are.   Her: That's so childish. Just give me my phone.   Me: Not until you give me my cigarettes. You know full well I hate it when you hide them. I've had this issue with you before. So I'm taking something YOU'RE  addicted to until you give me them back.   Her: You're a fucking horrible, spiteful person.   Me: No, you're just being a childish bitch. Just tell me where they are and you can have your phone.   Anyway, eventually she tells me where they are (they're in her top drawer of her bedside cabinet - which I NEVER go in). I give her her phone back and to me, the issue is resolved. However, she keeps saying how much of an arsehole (asshole) I am and won't let it go...so AITA?

The song's lyrics contain vicious insults to several East Coast rappers, chief among them, Shakur's former friend turned rival, The Notorious B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls. Section: From other artists Passage: Puffy had trouble understanding the sheer rage Shakur had expressed for Biggie in \"Hit 'Em Up\". He also responded by reinforcing his and Biggie's innocence regarding the shooting and went on to say that prior to the incident they \"were friends\", and that they \"would have never done nothing to hurt him.\" In an interview with Vibe Magazine concerning Shakur's allegations of Biggie and Puffy having prior knowledge of the ambush, Puffy stated:  He ain't mad at the niggas that shot him; he knows where they're at. He knows who shot him. If you ask him, he knows, and everybody in the street knows, and he's not stepping to them, because he knows that he's not gonna get away with that shit. To me, that's some real sucker shit. Be mad at everybody, man; don't be using niggas as scapegoats. We know that he's a nice guy from New York. All shit aside, Tupac is a nice, good-hearted guy.  Lil' Kim responded on the original version of her song \"Big Momma Thang\", which was aimed at Biggie's wife, Faith Evans, and Shakur. Junior M.A.F.I.A. recorded a music video for the song \"Get Money\", which has been regarded as a diss to Shakur. Biggie denies these claims, stating: \"It's just a video; ain't nobody got no time to make no diss on nobody.\" Lil' Cease said after the release that Biggie still had love for Shakur, and even respected him. The attack on Mobb Deep came as a response for their involvement on the song \"L.A L.A\" by Capone-N-Noreaga, which was a retaliation to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound's song \"New York, New York\" music video in which members of Tha Dogg Pound and Death Row are seen knocking down buildings in New York City. Mobb Deep responded to Shakur with the track \"Drop a Gem on 'em\". It was first released as a promotional single, and later appeared on their album Hell on Earth. Lyrically, it did not specifically name Shakur, but it did allude to the shooting incident.

{"question": "Title: Garth Hudson Background: Eric Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937) is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist. As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Section: Biography Passage: Hudson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. His parents, Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland, were musicians. His mother played piano and accordion and sang. His father, a farm inspector who had fought as a fighter pilot in World War I, played drums, C melody saxophone, clarinet, flute and piano. Hudson moved with his family to London, Ontario, around 1940. Classically trained in piano, music theory, harmony and counterpoint, Hudson wrote his first song at the age of eleven and first played professionally with dance bands in 1949 at the age of twelve. He attended Broughdale Public School and Medway High School before studying music (primarily Bach's chorales and The Well-Tempered Clavier) at the University of Western Ontario for one year; nevertheless, he grew increasingly frustrated with the rigidity of the classical repertoire.  In 1958, he joined a rock and roll band called \"the Capers\". He was reported to have said that he also gained some performance experience from playing at his uncle's funeral parlor. In December 1961, the 24-year-old Hudson joined the Hawks, the backing band for Ronnie Hawkins, which already consisted of 21-year-old Levon Helm on drums, 18-year-old Robbie Robertson on guitar, 18-year-old Rick Danko on bass and 18-year-old Richard Manuel on piano.  Fearing that his parents would think he was squandering his years of music education by playing in a rock and roll band, Hudson joined the band on the condition he be given the title \"music consultant\" and that his bandmates each pay him $10 a week for music lessons. Revealing a bit of the thinking behind his early fears, in The Last Waltz Hudson told interviewer-director Martin Scorsese: \"There is a view that jazz is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. They knew how to punch through music that would cure and make people feel good.\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: What year was he born Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: was he married Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Where was he from Answer: Hudson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

{"question": "Title: Lewis Fry Richardson Background: Lewis Fry Richardson was the youngest of seven children born to Catherine Fry (1838-1919) and David Richardson (1835-1913). They were a prosperous Quaker family, David Richardson operating a successful tanning and leather manufacturing business. At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham School in York, where he received an education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (a college of Durham University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. Section: Mathematical analysis of war Passage: Richardson also applied his mathematical skills in the service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the basis of international conflict. For this reason, he is now considered the initiator, or co-initiator (with Quincy Wright and Pitirim Sorokin as well as others such as Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapaport and Adam Curle), of the scientific analysis of conflict--an interdisciplinary topic of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation's armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself. Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be made regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations.  He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border. And in Arms and Insecurity (1949), and Statistics of Deadly Quarrels (1960), he sought to analyse the causes of war statistically. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.\"  In Statistics of Deadly Quarrels Richardson presented data on virtually every war from 1815 to 1945. As a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts. In other words, there are many more small fights, in which only a few people die, than large ones that kill many. While no conflict's size can be predicted beforehand--indeed, it is impossible to give an upper limit to the series--overall they do form a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed the same pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai. Others have noted that similar statistical patterns occur frequently, whether planned (lotteries, with many more small payoffs than large wins), or by natural organisation (there are more small towns with grocery stores than big cities with superstores). CANNOTANSWER  Question: What the mathematical analysis of war Answer: understanding the basis of international conflict. Question: How did he reasearch this?

{"question": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred.   In 1957 a Russian cargo plane is flying above Antarctica. In the cargo hold, three Russians sit with a padlocked box. The co-pilot leaves his seat and goes into the cargo hold, then begins to shoot the other men, who return fire. The chaos caused by the gunfight leads to a crash which kills all aboard.In modern times, newcomers arrive at the United States' AmundsenâScott South Pole Station in Antarctica, while others who are scheduled to leave are preparing to do so early because of a storm. They must depart before the onset of winter or remain for six months. Deputy U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) has been working in Antarctica for two years, since a betrayal by her partner in Miami that killed him and nearly killed her. She plans to retire after returning to the United States in two days.Stetko, her friend Doc (Tom Skerritt), and pilot Delfy (Columbus Short) fly to the remote Haworth Mesa to retrieve a discovered body. The dead man is Anton Weiss (Marc James Beauchamp), one of a group of three scientists looking for meteorites. An autopsy finds evidence of murder by axe. A murder requires a federal investigation; Stetko considers sending the body to McMurdo Station to avoid spending another winter in Antarctica, but decides to continue the investigation. When Stetko goes to speak to one of the others at Vostok Station, she finds him dying from a neck wound and is herself attacked by a black-clad man with an axe. Stetko injures her hands in escaping, losing the wet skin of her fingers on the metal handle of a door. Later, she finds Robert Pryce (Gabriel Macht), a United Nations security agent, examining the body of the second scientist. They conclude that the third, who is missing, must be the killer and set out to explore the groupâs most recent search site. There, Stetko falls through the ice to find the old Russian cargo plane. Pryce and Delfy join her to investigate, and they realize that the locked box had been opened and six cylinders removed. Pryce reveals that it is possible that nuclear fuel of interest to arms traffickers may be in the cylinders.After nearly being trapped by a cave-in at the plane, Stetko must have her badly frostbitten fingers amputated by Doc. She then finds the missing scientist hiding in her office. He tells her that he and his two companions found the plane and took the canisters, but the killer has them now. Before Stetko can protect him he is killed, but Carrie captures his killer, who is revealed to be Australian biologist Russell Haden (Alex O'Loughlin). The base commander orders everyone to evacuate because of the murders. With Haden locked in the brig and the winter storm near, Stetko and Pryce search for the canisters.Stetko checks the last departing plane's cargo manifest and learns that the bodies of the dead scientists were not aboard. She searches their body bags and notices that the stitching on Weiss's old wound matches the distinctive pattern on her amputated fingers. Stetko explores the body and finds several bags of large, uncut diamonds. Doc confesses that he was part of a diamond smuggling ring with the others before Haden killed the rest. He had hoped that the diamonds would make him wealthy outside Antarctica. When Doc tells Stetko he wants to see the aurora australis one last time, she allows him to walk outside to his death.Six months later, Stetko, Pryce, and Delfy have wintered at the facility. She transmits an email to her superior, rescinding her previous resignation and asking for a warmer location for her assignment., Question: Who took the plane?", "answer": "Answer: The missing scientist and his two companions."}

{"question": "In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage.   The European Commission ruled that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company releasing the strangle hold on this company's dominance in the marketplace?, Context: The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.

{"question": "Title: Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor Background: Charles V (Spanish: Carlos; German: Karl; Italian: Carlo; Latin: Carolus; Dutch: Karel; French: Charles,  24 February 1500 - 21 September 1558) was ruler of both the Spanish Empire as Charles I from 1516 and the Holy Roman Empire as Charles V from 1519, as well as of the lands of the former Duchy of Burgundy from 1506. He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. Section: Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire Passage: Charles fought continually with the Ottoman Empire and its sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent. The defeat of Hungary at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526 \"sent a wave of terror over Europe.\" The Muslim advance in Central Europe was halted at the Siege of Vienna in 1529.  Suleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Spanish victories such as the conquest of Tunis in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean after its victories at Preveza in 1538 and Djerba in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim Barbary corsairs, acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.  In 1536 Francis I of France allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a Franco-Ottoman alliance. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the Truce of Crepy-en-Laonnois. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating treaty with the Ottomans to gain himself some respite from the huge expenses of their war.  Charles V made overtures to the Safavid Empire to open a second front against the Ottomans, in an attempt at creating a Habsburg-Persian alliance. Contacts were positive, but rendered difficult by enormous distances. In effect, however, the Safavids did enter in conflict with the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman-Safavid War, forcing it to split its military resources.

Question: Which river involved in shipbuilding in the North East region of England is the longest? Passage:In February 1984, Nissan and the UK government signed an agreement to build a car plant in the UK. The following month a greenfield site in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, was chosen. As an incentive the land was offered to Nissan at agricultural prices; around £1,800 per acre. The North East region of England had recently undergone a period of industrial decline, with the closure of most of the shipyards on the Wear and Tyne, and the closure of many coal mines on the once prosperous Durham coalfield. The high unemployment this caused meant Nissan had a large, eager, manufacturing-skilled workforce to draw upon. The site, once the Sunderland Airfield (formerly RAF Usworth), was close to ports on the Wear and Tyne, within easy driving distance of the international Newcastle Airport, and close to major trunk roads such as the A1 and A19, as well as major ports for the export of vehicles. The established company became known as Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd, or NMUK.

{"question": "How many ways are there to divide a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets? Relevant Theorem: In combinatorics, Lah numbers are a sequence of numbers that arise in the study of permutations and combinations. They are denoted by L(n, k) and are defined as the number of ways to arrange n distinct items into k non-empty linear lists, where each list is ordered, and the order of the lists also matters. In other words, Lah numbers count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty ordered subsets.  Lah numbers can be expressed using factorials and Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are denoted by S(n, k). The formula for Lah numbers is:  L(n, k) = (n - 1)! * S(n, k) * k!  where n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to n, and S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.  Some properties of Lah numbers include:  1. L(n, 1) = (n - 1)! for all n ≥ 1, since there is only one way to arrange n items into a single ordered list. 2. L(n, n) = n! for all n ≥ 1, since there are n! ways to arrange n items into n ordered lists, each containing one item. 3. L(n, k) = 0 for k > n, since it is not possible to arrange n items into more than n non-empty ordered lists.  Lah numbers have applications in various areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, probability theory, and the study of special functions.", "answer": "1200"}

{"question": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document. The title should convey the main idea/event/topic about which the document is being written. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link].   The nature of the inquiry is unclear  but the probe is focused on Ballou High School  where allegations were first raised about diplomas wrongly awarded to chronically truant students. The federal agencies involved are the FBI and the U.S. Department of Education Inspector General’s Office. Those agencies and the D.C. Inspector General’s Office declined to comment and would not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. The current and former District employees said investigators are reviewing what happened at  Ballou  last year  when more than half of the class graduated despite missing too much school — with some seniors racking up more than 100 absences. In January  a school system attorney went to  Ballou  and met with educators who taught ­seniors during the 2016-2017 academic year and asked them to turn over documents as part of a “federal investigation ” according to government employees familiar with the visit. The attorney asked the teachers to hand over paper documentation they still had from students  including sign-in sheets  notes on parent-teacher conferences or behavior incidents. The existence of an investigation adds another dimension to a scandal that has engulfed the school system since November  when allegations arose that Ballou permitted students to graduate even when they barely showed up to school. Records shared with The Washington Post by a former schools employee showed that some students missed more than 100 days of school but still received diplomas and that other students were allowed to take makeup classes in violation of district policy. Emails shared with The Post showed that  the Ballou principal  instructed teachers to improperly input grades.  The principal  did not respond to inquiries about grading.

{"question": "Title: Good Night, and Good Luck Background: Good Night, and Good Luck is a 2005 American historical drama film directed by George Clooney and starring David Strathairn, George Clooney, Robert Downey, Jr., Patricia Clarkson and Jeff Daniels. The movie was written by Clooney and Grant Heslov (both of whom also have acting roles in the film) and portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti-Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Although released in black and white, Good Night, and Good Luck was filmed on color film stock but on a greyscale set, and was color corrected to black and white during post-production. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility, and also addresses what occurs when the media offer a voice of dissent from government policy. Section: Production Passage: In September 2005, Clooney explained his interest in the story to an audience at the New York Film Festival: \"I thought it was a good time to raise the idea of using fear to stifle political debate.\" Having majored in journalism in college, Clooney was well-versed in the subject matter. His father, Nick Clooney, was a television journalist for many years, appearing as an anchorman in Cincinnati, Ohio, Salt Lake City, Utah, Los Angeles, California, and Buffalo, New York. The elder Clooney also ran for Congress in 2004.  George Clooney was paid $1 each for writing, directing, and acting in Good Night, and Good Luck., which cost $7.5 million to make. Due to an injury he received on the set of Syriana a few months earlier, Clooney could not pass the tests to be insured. He then mortgaged his own house in Los Angeles in order to make the film. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and former eBay president Jeff Skoll invested money in the project as executive producers. The film ultimately grossed more than $54 million worldwide.  The CBS offices and studios seen in the movie were all sets on a soundstage. To accomplish a pair of scenes showing characters going up an elevator, different \"floors\" of the building were laid out on the same level. The \"elevator\" was actually built on a large turntable at the intersection of the two floor sets, and rotated once the doors were closed. When the doors reopened, the actors appeared to be in a different location. In doing so, the movie exercised a bit of dramatic license--the CBS executive offices at the time were located at 485 Madison Avenue. CBS News was located in an office building just north of Grand Central Terminal (demolished and now the site of the Met Life Building); and the See It Now studio was located in Grand Central Terminal itself, above the waiting room. For dramatic effect, all three areas were depicted as being in the same building.  Clooney and producer Grant Heslov decided to use only archival footage of Joseph McCarthy in his depiction. As all of that footage was black-and-white, that determined the color scheme of the film. A young Robert Kennedy is also shown in the movie during McCarthy's hearing sessions. He was then a staff member on the Senate subcommittee chaired by McCarthy. CANNOTANSWER  Question: How was Good Night, and Good Luck produced? Answer: The CBS offices and studios seen in the movie were all sets on a soundstage. Question: Was  the production successful? Answer: The film ultimately grossed more than $54 million worldwide. Question: Who was involved in the production of this film? Answer: Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and former eBay president Jeff Skoll invested money in the project as executive producers.

{"question": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.   A union representing public sector staff said it would be an \"absolute disaster\", depriving the Welsh economy of more than £1bn. George Osborne will also announce a cut in the top rate of income tax. Welsh Conservative MP Guto Bebb said the cut would be a \"difficult policy to sell\". The Budget comes on the day that official statistics show wages in Wales are the lowest in the UK, behind Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics said the median annual income for public sector workers was £21,258 last year - 19% more than the private sector figure of £17,177. The UK government is examining how public sector pay can be brought into line with the private sector. But critics say it would mean a pay cut for people in poorer parts of the UK. Last autumn, Mr Osborne asked independent pay review bodies to report in the summer on whether the public sector could be \"made more responsive to local labour markets\". But the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which has members working for the UK and devolved governments, said the proposal would hit Wales particularly hard. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Wales has the biggest public-private pay gap in the UK. Women in Wales can earn an extra 18.5% and men an extra 18% in the public sector than they could expect to make working for private companies with similar qualifications, the think tank estimates. PCS senior national officer Jeff Evans said: \"What these figures demonstrate is that regional pay would also be an absolute disaster for the Welsh economy.\" 'Real impact' The gap could be only be closed by holding down public employees' pay while wages in the private sector rise in line with inflation, he added. \"The real impact on the Welsh economy would be even greater, however, since the reduced spending power of public sector workers would translate into reduced revenues and wages in private sector businesses that currently benefit from that spending,\" he added. First Minister Carwyn Jones has described the proposal as \"ludicrous\" and as \"code for cutting pay in Wales\". New Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood on Tuesday night invited him and other Welsh party leaders to unite in opposition to the proposal. Treasury officials say it would ensure the UK has a responsive, modern labour force. Growth They see the move as \"pro-growth\", saying it would help make the private sector become more competitive. Mr Osborne is also expected to raise the threshold at which anyone pays income tax to more than £9,000 next year, leaving the average standard rate taxpayer £305 a year better off. He will announce a cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, but not for a year. Payable on income over £150,000, the 50p rate was introduced in April 2010 in what Labour said at the time was a temporary move. Mr Bebb, Tory MP for Aberconwy, told BBC Radio Wales: \"It'll be a very difficult policy to sell in terms of the signal being sent out because clearly when the chancellor says we're all in this together the 50p tax rate was part and parcel of that message. \"It depends upon how it's rebalanced - what other taxes will be brought in to try to counter balance any loss of income as a result of this change.\" Mr Bebb said a \"timetable for its abolition would be understandable\" if the rate was not generating money for the Treasury. He added that the chancellor \"had to make decisions which are right for the financial viability of the country\".", "answer": "The chancellor has been urged not to introduce regional pay in the public sector as he prepares to deliver his Budget."}

{"question": "Title: John Connally Background: John Bowden Connally Jr. (February 27, 1917 - June 15, 1993) was an American politician. He served as the 39th Governor of Texas and as the 61st United States Secretary of the Treasury. He began his career as a Democrat but switched to the Republican Party in 1973. Born in Floresville, Texas, Connally pursued a legal career after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin. Section: Presidential run Passage: Connally announced in January 1979 that he would seek the Republican nomination for President in 1980. He was considered a great orator and strong leader and was featured on the cover of Time with the heading \"Hot on the Trail\". His wheeler-dealer image remained a liability. Connally raised more money than any other candidate, but he was never able to overtake the popular conservative front runner Ronald Reagan of California. Connally spent his money nationally, while George H. W. Bush, who was from Houston like Connally, targeted his time and money in early states and won the Iowa caucus. The Houston political activist Clymer Wright rejected both Connally and Bush and served as Reagan's finance chairman in Texas. Bush's status as a challenger to Reagan was at first heightened by his victory in Iowa. Connally drew the backing of Republican State Representative Fred Agnich of Dallas, former president of Texas Instruments.  Connally focused on South Carolina, an early primary state in which he had the support of popular U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, but he lost there to Reagan 55 to 30 percent and withdrew from the contest. After spending $11 million during the campaign, Connally secured the support of only a single delegate, Ada Mills of Clarksville, Arkansas, who became nationally known for a brief time as the \"$11 million delegate\".  Connally quickly endorsed Reagan, appeared with the former governor at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, fundraisers, and other campaign events. He helped Reagan to win a narrow primary victory over Bush in Texas. During a press conference, Connally was asked if he thought Reagan was the best man to be president. Connally naughtily replied: \"I think he's the second best man I can think of.\"  Connally said that he and Bush despised each other. The statement seemed to contradict Connally's earlier insistence that President Nixon name Bush to a post in the administration as a pre-condition for Connally's agreeing to become treasury secretary. Rumors also abounded in 1964 that Connally personally voted for Bush for senator because of his greater dislike for Bush's then-opponent, Senator Ralph Yarborough. Bad feeling between Yarborough and both Connally and Vice-President Johnson was evident in the early stages of President Kennedy's tour of Texas in November 1963. Among other things, it was widely reported at the time that Yarborough had refused to travel in Johnson's car, although, after Kennedy's intervention and Connally's agreement to give Yarborough a more prominent role in functions planned for Austin, he did so during the fatal motorcade in Dallas. Charles Keating once contributed to Connally's campaign for President. CANNOTANSWER  Question: when did he run for president? Answer: 1980. Question: Who was he running against? Answer: Ronald Reagan Question: Did he run as democrat or republican Answer: Republican Question: What was his platform?", "answer": "He was considered a great orator and strong leader and was featured on the cover of Time with the heading \"Hot on the Trail\"."}

Ceyhan says he, like many others in Turkey, has been driven to brewing his own beer by the high price of commercially produced alcoholic drinks and the hefty taxes imposed by Turkey’s ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party. “I might never have started this if beer wasn’t so expensive,” the 25-year old university student said. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, a pious Muslim known for his dislike of alcohol, taxes on booze have increased steadily and now account for two thirds of the cost of some alcoholic drinks. From early 2003, when Erdogan came to power, to October 2017, prices of raki - a traditional aniseed-flavored spirit - have jumped by 665 percent and beer prices by 580 percent, according to data from the Turkish Statistics Institute (TUIK). “What surprised me when I got into this was the cost. If I can make it this cheaply, it’s strange that commercial beers are so expensive,” said Ceyhan. He makes beer from an online kit, while others brew cider, lagers and wine. Some also dilute shop-bought ethanol to make their version of vodka or raki. While only a small portion of Turkey’s 80 million people drink alcohol regularly, many of those who do are determined not to be denied their tipple by the rising prices - even though drinking home-brewed alcohol is not without its risks. Following the latest 10 percent increase in alcohol duty, which came into effect in December, the number of people producing their own drinks has grown, distributors say. “It’s like a hidden reflex, a desire to be self-sufficient. We don’t know what will be restricted or what they will allow tomorrow,” said a 58-year old brewer, who asked to remain anonymous fearing a potential backlash. “It’s as easy as making coffee, but it’s ready in about a month,” said the civil servant from Ankara, who makes wines and beers of different flavors, including raspberry and coffee. He said a bottle of his homemade beer costs around a quarter of the price in the shops. Erdogan’s distaste for alcohol stands in contrast to modern Turkey’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who championed secularism and was often pictured with a glass of raki. The president has criticized alcohol consumption as morally harmful to society, insisting that Turkey’s national beverage is not raki but the non-alcoholic yoghurt drink ayran. As of 2013, all advertisements, promotions and sponsorships of alcohol and tobacco products have been banned in Turkey. Such products are frequently blurred out in television shows. The surging taxes have reduced the volume of commercial alcoholic drinks sold in Turkey, with beer sales falling 10 percent between 2012 and 2016, and raki sales dropping by nearly a quarter, according to data from Turkey’s tobacco and alcohol watchdog (TAPDK). Cagatay Mekiker, marketing director for Turkey’s second- largest producer and distributor of alcoholic beverages, Antalya Alkollu Icecekler, said sales of ethanol had risen as part of a “rebellion” against the tax rises. He did not give a figure for the increased ethanol sales but Arda Gurdal, marketing director at drinks company AFS Icecekler said sales rose by up to 5 or 6 percent in the past year. Since the December hike, tax now constitutes nearly two-thirds of the 93 lira ($24) price of a standard 70 centiliter bottle of raki at the supermarket. One bottle costs more than 6 percent of the minimum monthly wage in Turkey. A bottle of Antalya Alkollu Icecekler’s ethanol sells for half that price at one of Turkey’s main supermarket chains, and can make up to 4 liters of drink, brewers say. Mekiker said the final product from some mixtures was not “real raki”. Even advocates of the home-mixed drinks admit that diluting ethanol with water and aniseed flavoring is not the same as making an authentic drink - and admit there are dangers. In 2015, several people in Turkey died of alcohol poisoning, predominantly from bootleg alcohol used in the mixing of raki, while others went blind from improperly mixing alcohols, which can have a purity level of up to 95 percent. For some, though, the over-riding factor is cost. “Am I crazy? Why would I bother making drinks of poor quality at home instead of drinking the fine ones if it wasn’t for prices?” said 23-year old Memet Yucekaya, who uses ethanol.", "answer": "Steep alcohol taxes drive Turkey's drinkers to home-brew."}

{"question": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question.   Background Paragraph: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.  Story: Bill was studying the states of matter. First, he selected a matter with low boiling point. He labeled it as matter A. To compare it with a well-known matter he selected water. He labeled it as matter B. He also selected ice, which he labeled as matter C. He is now better prepared to compare their states.  Question: Which matter is less needed by living things, matter B or matter C?", "answer": "matter C."}

I feel like i could've been more understanding but i still stand by the decision i have made.  &amp;  now my question is: Am i the asshole?

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   Polyploidization is a natural process that frequently accompanies differentiation; its deregulation is linked to genomic instability and cancer. Despite its relevance, why cells select different polyploidization mechanisms is unknown. Here we report a systematic genetic analysis of endomitosis, a process in which megakaryocytes become polyploid by entering mitosis but aborting anaphase. Whereas ablation of the APC/C cofactor Cdc20 results in mitotic arrest and severe thrombocytopenia, lack of the kinases Aurora-B, Cdk1, or Cdk2 does not affect megakaryocyte polyploidization or platelet levels. Ablation of Cdk1 forces a switch to endocycles without mitosis, whereas polyploidization in the absence of Cdk1 and Cdk2 occurs in the presence of aberrant re-replication events. Importantly, ablation of these kinases rescues the defects in Cdc20 null megakaryocytes. These findings suggest that endomitosis can be functionally replaced by alternative polyploidization mechanisms in vivo and provide the cellular basis for therapeutic approaches aimed to discriminate mitotic and polyploid cells.", "answer": "Functional reprogramming of polyploidization in megakaryocytes."}

{"question": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was in Colwyn Bay as part of an eve-of-election tour of Britain. Brexit minister David Jones was campaigning for the Conservatives in Alyn and Deeside and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood was in Rhondda. UKIP activists joined the campaign trail in the south Wales valleys. The Liberal Democrats were mainly focusing on local campaigning. It follows visits by Lib Dem leader Tim Farron to Montgomeryshire and Prime Minister Theresa May to Clwyd South on Tuesday. Mr Farron defended attacking Conservative social care policy during the trip, even though it only applies in England. Mr Corbyn told supporters in Colwyn Bay this was his 87th rally of the election campaign. \"Above all, we are people coming together with a view, a vision and a dream of the kind of world that we can create - born of social justice and solidarity,\" he said. Urging party activists to support Labour candidates \"flat out all day tomorrow\" he said: \"Go for it, let's deliver that historic victory\". \"2017 will be the year they will never ever forget - we'll win.\" Speaking during a visit to Cardiff Docks, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox claimed the campaign had ended as it had begun. \"This is ultimately about who is going to be best to negotiate Britain's exit from the European Union, and its important not just in itself but because that settlement will determine the other things that we want,\" he said. \"It will have a lot of economic impact, it will determine our future relations with the European Union, and it will also have an impact on our trading relationship beyond the European Union.\" \"The country, the United Kingdom as a whole will benefit from a strong, negotiated position for Brexit, and that's best done by Theresa May and the Conservatives.\" Ms Wood, who addressed supporters in Treorchy on Wednesday, is targeting Rhondda after becoming AM for the area in last year's assembly election, snatching the seat from Labour. But she drew criticism from senior Plaid figures in April for suggesting she might stand for Rhondda at Westminster and then later ruling it out. Ms Wood said she could not see her party joining a coalition in Westminster if no party wins an overall majority. She said that Plaid would instead \"seek to maximise Wales' voice... if we were in the position of holding the balance of power\". Plaid has held three seats in the House of Commons since 2005. \"A good result would be an increase on the number of seats that we have now,\" Ms Wood said. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mark Williams said people were \"crying out for hope\" and his party offered voters a \"chance to change the direction of your country\". \"In this election the Welsh Liberal Democrats offer hope of a better start in life for our children, hope of an economy that works for us all, and hope of for a decent, tolerant country. \"We don't have to accept the divided, cold, and mean-spirited country that I fear we are becoming. We can be better than that.\" Also campaigning in the south Wales valleys, UKIP Wales secretary Ian Williams denied his party was a \"one trick pony - it's not all about Brexit.\" \"On the doorstep immigration is still a large, maybe probably 70-80% of what people are talking to us about,\" he said. \"We have a fully costed manifesto.

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   When the central nervous system (CNS) is under viral attack, defensive antiviral responses must necessarily arise from the CNS itself to rapidly and efficiently curb infections with minimal collateral damage to the sensitive, specialized and non-regenerating neural tissue. This presents a unique challenge because an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lack of proper lymphatic drainage keeps the CNS virtually outside the radar of circulating immune cells that are at constant vigilance for antigens in peripheral tissues. Limited antigen presentation skills of CNS cells in comparison to peripheral tissues is because of a total lack of dendritic cells and feeble expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in neurons and glia. However, research over the past two decades has identified immune effector mechanisms intrinsic to the CNS for immediate tackling, attenuating and clearing of viral infections, with assistance pouring in from peripheral circulation in the form of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells at a later stage. Specialized CNS cells, microglia and astrocytes, were regarded as sole sentinels of the brain for containing a viral onslaught but neurons held little recognition as a potential candidate for protecting itself from the proliferation and pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses. Accumulating evidence however indicates that extracellular insult causes neurons to express immune factors characteristic of lymphoid tissues. This article aims to comprehensively analyze current research on this conditional alteration in the protein expression repertoire of neurons and the role it plays in CNS innate immune response to counter viral infections. ß", "answer": "Neurons under viral attack: Victims or warriors?"}

{"question": "Title: Lenape Background: The Lenape (English:  or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. Section: 17th century Passage: New Amsterdam was founded in 1624 by the Dutch in what would later become New York City. Dutch settlers also founded a colony at present-day Lewes, Delaware on June 3, 1631 and named it Zwaanendael (Swan Valley). The colony had a short life, as in 1632 a local band of Lenape killed the 32 Dutch settlers after a misunderstanding escalated over Lenape defacement of the insignia of the Dutch West India Company. In 1634, the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock went to war with the Lenape over access to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. They defeated the Lenape, and some scholars believe that the Lenape may have become tributaries to the Susquehannock. After the warfare, the Lenape referred to the Susquehannock as \"uncles.\" The Iroquois added the Lenape to the Covenant Chain in 1676; the Lenape were tributary to the Five Nations (later Six) until 1753, shortly before the outbreak of the French and Indian War (a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe).  The Lenape's quick adoption of trade goods, and their need to trap furs to meet high European demand, resulted in their disastrous over-harvesting of the beaver population in the lower Hudson Valley. With the fur sources exhausted, the Dutch shifted their operations to present-day upstate New York. The Lenape who produced wampum in the vicinity of Manhattan Island temporarily forestalled the negative effects of the decline in trade. Lenape population fell sharply during this period, due to high fatalities from epidemics of infectious diseases carried by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity, as the diseases had arisen on the Asian continent and moved west into Europe, where they had become endemic in the cities.  The Lenape had a culture in which the clan and family controlled property. Europeans often tried to contract for land with the tribal chiefs, confusing their culture with that of neighboring tribes such as the Iroquois. The Lenape would petition for grievances on the basis that not all their families had been recognized in the transaction (not that they wanted to \"share\" the land). After the Dutch arrival in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement until the 1660s to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson. The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, which allowed settlement west of the Hudson within the province of New Netherland. This land was purchased from the Lenape after the fact.  In 1682, William Penn and Quaker colonists created the English colony of Pennsylvania beginning at the lower Delaware River. A peace treaty was negotiated between the newly arriving English and Lenape at what is now known as Penn Treaty Park. In the decades immediately following, some 20,000 new colonists arrived in the region, putting pressure on Lenape settlements and hunting grounds. Although Penn endeavored to live peaceably with the Lenape and to create a colony that would do the same, he also expected his authority and that of the colonial government to take precedence. His new colony effectively displaced many Lenape and forced others to adapt to new cultural demands. Penn gained a reputation for benevolence and tolerance, but his efforts resulted in more effective colonization of the ancestral Lenape homeland than previous ones.

This method, which we refer to as progressive dynamic hurdles (PDH), allows models that are consistently performing well to train for more steps. It begins as ordinary tournament selection evolutionary architecture search with early stopping, with each child model training for a relatively small $s_0$ number of steps before being evaluated for fitness. However, after a predetermined number of child models, $m$ , have been evaluated, a hurdle, $h_0$ , is created by calculating the the mean fitness of the current population. For the next $m$ child models produced, models that achieve a fitness greater than $h_0$ after $s_0$ train steps are granted an additional $s_1$ steps of training and then are evaluated again to determine their final fitness.

{"question": "In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.   Passage: \"Shine\" is a reggae pop and ska song that lasts three minutes and 24 seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \"crawling beat\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \"mellow beat\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \"party-vibe production\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \"child whisperer\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \"Shine!\" and Williams screaming \"Hey!\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\" and \"that bear with the red hat\", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include \"Pharrell's 'Happy\"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge\" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents \"without sounding overly patronizing\". \"Shine\" ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.When discussing the development of the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics. Williams was more \"specific\" regarding the lyrics as he wanted to include words directly connected to the film and its character like \"bear\", \"Paddington\", and \"station\"; Stefani said that she preferred for the song to be a \"little more abstract\". She later reversed this view, saying that she agreed with Williams' interpretation after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animations of the Paddington Bear character. In an interview with American Top 40, Stefani credited Williams as being central to the recording's development, saying that he was \"the one who really got in there and was able to channel the film lyrically and make it really happen\".  Question: What publication did the artist that repeatedly sings the word \"Shine!\" tell that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics?", "answer": "MTV News."}

{"question": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not.   Recently my father, who I haven't seen since I was 4-years-old (I'm 27 now), messaged me on Facebook to tell me that he might be dying, so naturally I felt compelled to respond.   But, after speaking with him a bit through Facebook messages I found out that he's just going to get some additional medical tests after having a somewhat concerning urine test during a routine physical — something his doctor told him could indicate a \\*possible\\* cancer diagnosis. Which still would not necessarily mean that he's about to die. He has learned nothing yet and I felt that his initial message to me was a little deceptive.   I understand why he would take the opportunity to try to get me to talk to him, but I reallllly don't like feeling as though I'm being manipulated. Even though I felt this way I said that I would be open to speaking with him on the phone in the future, but that I needed some time to feel comfortable doing so. He suggested we talk over the weekend, but I never responded to his message, since I'm still not feeling super comfortable engaging with him and he is not in fact dying.   Then, come Sunday, I received another message from him, clearly irritated that I did not call him. Now, I feel pretty confidant that I don't want to reconnect with him.  He's been trying to get in touch with me off and on for the past couple of years, but since he abruptly left my life 23 years ago I haven't really felt inclined to reconnect. And, even before he left my life completely he treated me pretty terribly, leaving me places unattended, talking poorly about my mother in her absence - something she never did, and he just always made me really uncomfortable.   I don't like that he manipulated me into speaking with him initially and I don't like that he's already expressed anger towards me. I feel like there's nothing to gain from this relationship, so I don't know why I would continue trying to reconnect. And, just the thought of speaking to him triggers a sense of fear and anxiety within me.  My friends are concerned that if I don't speak to him at some point that I will eventually regret not knowing him and feel horrible when he does die eventually. But...I don't think I will. I feel like I already know him, and he's not a great guy. I love the family that actually raised me so much, they're my favorite people and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.  So, would I be the asshole if I just didn't try to reconnect with him?  &amp;", "answer": "deciding not to reconnect with my estranged father"}

{"question": "Title: Super Furry Animals Background: Super Furry Animals are a Welsh psychedelic rock band. Since their formation in Cardiff, Wales, in 1993, the band has consisted of Gruff Rhys (lead vocals, guitar), Huw Bunford (lead guitar, vocals), Guto Pryce (bass guitar), Cian Ciaran (keyboards, synthesisers, various electronics, occasional guitar, vocals) and Dafydd Ieuan (drums, vocals). Actor Rhys Ifans is also a former member. Super Furry Animals have recorded nine UK Albums Chart Top 25 studio albums (one BPI certified Gold and four certified Silver), plus numerous singles, EPs, compilations and collaborations. Section: 1999-2000: Guerrilla and Mwng Passage: In 1999, NME readers named them 'best new band' in January (this despite the fact it was now three years since they released their debut album). In May, the single \"Northern Lites\" was released and made No. 11 in the charts. A dense production, with steel drums clattering out a calypso rhythm whilst Rhys sang an irreverent lyric about the El Nino-Southern Oscillation weather phenomenon, it was an apt taster for the new album, Guerrilla. Recorded at the Real World Studios, the album retained SFA's pop melodies but took a less guitar-centric approach to their execution and was their most experimental work to date. Layers of samples over brass, percussion and Gruff's melodic singing produced an album which took the freewheeling approach of 1960s groups such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Velvet Underground and updated it to the late 1990s. The album swung from glam and garage rock numbers (\"Night Vision\", \"The Teacher\") to novelty techno (\"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\"), ambient indietronica (\"Some Things Come From Nothing\") and upbeat drum and bass (\"The Door To This House Remains Open\"). For the cover art, Pete Fowler created the band's first three-dimensional models, rather than the paintings he had supplied for the Radiator album and singles.  After playing several of the summer festivals, SFA released \"Fire in My Heart\", the most soulful track from Guerrilla, in August and saw it chart at No. 25. They then embarked on a US and UK tour. SFA finished their UK tour at the Cardiff International Arena in Cardiff, where they showcased the first ever concert in surround sound and broadcast it on the World Wide Web.  January 2000 involved a series of changes for SFA. The last single from Guerrilla, \"Do or Die\", was released and made No. 20. It was also the last single SFA released on Creation Records, as founder Alan McGee set off to pursue other interests. It had always been SFA's plan to release their next album on their own label, Placid Casual, as it would be a deliberate sidestep from their recent work: a largely acoustic album of Welsh language songs entitled Mwng. Meaning \"mane\", its lilting melodies established that SFA's songwriting did not have to fall back on head-spinning production tricks. A limited edition (of 3000) 7 inch record, \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" (meaning \"Sunny Intervals\") preceded Mwng in May 2000. It came backed with \"Charge\", a hard-rock jam recorded as a Peel Session for the BBC. The album, released the same month, sold remarkably well for a non-English LP - it made No. 11 in the charts - and received a rare distinction for a pop record, being commended in Parliament for its efforts in keeping the Welsh language alive.  2000 also saw the Furries contribute two tracks, Free Now and Peter Blake 2000, for the Liverpool Sound Collage project, which was nominated for a Grammy. They undertook this remixing of unreleased Beatles recordings at the invitation of Paul McCartney, whom they had met at the NME Awards, where they had won Best Live Act.

{"question": "Title: Elroy Hirsch Background: Elroy Leon \"Crazylegs\" Hirsch (June 17, 1923 - January 28, 2004) was an American football player, sport executive and actor. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. He was also named to the all-time All-Pro team selected in 1968 and to the National Football League (NFL) 1950s All-Decade Team. A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Hirsch played college football as a halfback at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, helping to lead both the 1942 Badgers and the 1943 Wolverines to No. 3 rankings in the final AP Polls. Section: Michigan Passage: In January 1943, Hirsch enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was transferred to the University of Michigan as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. In early September 1943, he broke the record at Michigan's Marine Corps training center, completing a 344-yard obstacle course in one minute and 31 seconds. He was the starting left halfback in the first seven games of the season for Fritz Crisler's 1943 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled an 8-1 record and was ranked No. 3 in the final AP Poll. After watching Hirsch in pre-season practice, Associated Press football writer Jerry Liska referred to \"squirming Elroy Hirsch\" as \"Wisconsin's gold-plated wartime gift to Michigan.\" Hirsch and Bill Daley (a V-12 transfer from Minnesota) became Michigan's most powerful offensive weapons during the 1943 season and were dubbed Michigan's \"lend-lease backs.\"  In his first game for Michigan, Hirsch returned the opening kickoff 50 yards, scored two touchdowns and intercepted a pass. He scored five touchdowns in Michigan's first three games and threw for a touchdown in the fourth game against Notre Dame. On October 11, 1943, Hirsch scored three touchdowns, including a 61-yard reverse around the right end, and intercepted a pass to help Michigan to its first victory over Minnesota since 1932. Due to a shoulder injury, he appeared only briefly as a backup to kick for extra points in the final two games of the season, but he still led the Wolverines in passing, punt returns, and scoring.  During the 1943-1944 academic year, Hirsch also won varsity letters in basketball (as a center), track (as a broad jumper), and baseball (as a pitcher), becoming the first Michigan athlete to letter in four sports in a single year. He averaged 7.3 points per game for the 1943-44 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, compiled a 6-0 record as a pitcher for the Michigan baseball team, placed third in the long jump in the 1944 indoor championship, and led all three teams to Big Ten Conference championships. On May 13, 1944, Hirsch starred in two sports in the same day, winning the broad jump with a distance of 24 feet, 2-1/4 inches at a track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and then traveling to Columbus, Ohio, where he pitched a one-hitter to give Michigan's baseball team a 5-0 victory over Ohio State.

As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. Section: The Mega Powers (1988-1989) Passage: Hogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, however, Hogan finally lost the title to Andre on the February 5 episode of The Main Event after a convoluted scam involving \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After Andre delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, Andre handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and Andre were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop Andre interfering which helped \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title.  Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers. After Savage became WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (Andre the Giant and Ted DiBiase) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam. They then went on to feud with Slick's Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man.  In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his \"War Bonnet\", a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether. The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series Are You Serious? in 2012.  The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by The Twin Towers himself. In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3 episode of The Main Event, when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage, who slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself. After the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, which started a feud between the two. Their feud culminated in Hogan beating Savage for his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What is the Mega Powers? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Who was in the Mega Powers? Answer: Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers.

{"question": "Title: John Cage Background: John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 - August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. Section: 1969-87: New departures Passage: Cage's work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting the mood of the era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. HPSCHD (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with fifty-two tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 slides of designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four slide projectors, with forty motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.  Also in 1969, Cage produced the first fully notated work in years: Cheap Imitation for piano. The piece is a chance-controlled reworking of Erik Satie's Socrate, and, as both listeners and Cage himself noted, openly sympathetic to its source. Although Cage's affection for Satie's music was well-known, it was highly unusual for him to compose a personal work, one in which the composer is present. When asked about this apparent contradiction, Cage replied: \"Obviously, Cheap Imitation lies outside of what may seem necessary in my work in general, and that's disturbing. I'm the first to be disturbed by it.\" Cage's fondness for the piece resulted in a recording--a rare occurrence, since Cage disliked making recordings of his music--made in 1976. Overall, Cheap Imitation marked a major change in Cage's music: he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments, and tried out several new approaches, such as improvisation, which he previously discouraged, but was able to use in works from the 1970s, such as Child of Tree (1975).  Cheap Imitation became the last work Cage performed in public himself. Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960, and by the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform. Nevertheless, he still played Cheap Imitation during the 1970s, before finally having to give up performing. Preparing manuscripts also became difficult: before, published versions of pieces were done in Cage's calligraphic script; now, manuscripts for publication had to be completed by assistants. Matters were complicated further by David Tudor's departure from performing, which happened in early 1970s. Tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead, and so Cage, for the first time in two decades, had to start relying on commissions from other performers, and their respective abilities. Such performers included Grete Sultan, Paul Zukofsky, Margaret Leng Tan, and many others. Aside from music, Cage continued writing books of prose and poetry (mesostics). M was first published by Wesleyan University Press in 1973. In January 1978 Cage was invited by Kathan Brown of Crown Point Press to engage in printmaking, and Cage would go on to produce series of prints every year until his death; these, together with some late watercolors, constitute the largest portion of his extant visual art. In 1979 Cage's Empty Words was first published by Wesleyan University Press. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was the first piece that he composed? Answer: HPSCHD (1969), Question: Which piece did he achieve fame for? Answer: Cheap Imitation Question: Did he work with any other composers in this period of his life?

{"question": "Title: Elton Wieman Background: Elton Ewart \"Tad\" Wieman (October 4, 1896 - December 26, 1971) was an American football collegiate player, coach and athletic director. He played football for the University of Michigan from 1915 to 1917 and 1920 under head coach Fielding H. Yost. He was a coach and administrator at Michigan from 1921 to 1929, including two years as the school's head football coach. He later served as a football coach at the University of Minnesota (1930-1931), Princeton University (1932-1942), and Columbia University (1944-1945), and as an athletic director at the University of Maine (1946-1951) and University of Denver (1951-1962). Section: Freshman season Passage: In 1915, Wieman enrolled at Michigan. Wieman worked nights to pay for his expenses and studied into the morning to keep up with his classes.  Though he had only played rugby football before coming to Michigan, Wieman played on Michigan's freshman football team. Wieman's hometown newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, followed his progress, reporting in October 1915 that he was \"making quite a reputation for himself as tackle on the freshman eleven\" and noting that \"Coach Yost seems to be quite pleased with his work.\" As Wieman progressed, the Times ran a feature story reporting that \"the big, raw-boned freshman from Southern California\" was stopping Michigan's top varsity players, including All-American John Maulbetsch, and leaving them piled up \"in a squirming heap.\" Coach Yost was reported to have bawled many varsity players for their inability to get past Wieman, with Maulbetsch complaining, \"It can't be done, coach.\" Each night, the varsity players reportedly swore to get Wieman, but never did. Wieman reportedly took the punishment and came up from under the pile each time smiling. Wieman also demonstrated his talent on offense:  \"He is used by the freshmen on end-around plays. He has a peculiar way of running with a loose hitch in his hips that shakes off tacklers. He also handles the ball well and is the best man at catching forward passes among the freshmen. Wieman gives Rugby (the English game he played in California) and basketball the credit for his ability to catch the ball. On punts he is generally waiting for his man to catch the ball.\"  If it were not for the ban on freshmen play, the Times concluded there was no doubt that he would be playing on the varsity team.

{"question": "Title: Isaac Hayes Background: Isaac Hayes, Jr. was born in Covington, Tennessee, in Tipton County. He was the second child of Eula (nee Wade) and Isaac Hayes, Sr. After his mother died young and his father abandoned his family, Isaac, Jr., was raised by his maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Willie Wade, Sr. The child of a sharecropper family, he grew up working on farms in Shelby County, Tennessee, and in Tipton County. Section: Return to fame and stardom Passage: In 1995, Hayes appeared as a Las Vegas minister impersonating himself in the comedy series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He launched a comeback on the Virgin label in May 1995 with Branded, an album of new material that earned impressive sales figures as well as positive reviews from critics who proclaimed it a return to form. A companion album released around the same time, Raw and Refined, featured a collection of previously unreleased instrumentals, both old and new. Hayes worked on the theme for the 1996 theatrical release 'Beavis and Butt-Head Do America', producing a piece which was essentially a hybrid of 'The Theme From Shaft' and the theme from the original 'Beavis and Butt-Head' TV show.  Soon after, Hayes joined the founding cast of Comedy Central's animated TV series, South Park. Hayes provided the voice for the character of \"Chef\", the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, from the show's debut on August 13, 1997 (one week shy of his 55th birthday), through the end of its ninth season in 2006. The role of Chef drew on Hayes's talents both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character's penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. An album of songs from the series appeared in 1998 with the title Chef Aid: The South Park Album reflecting Chef's popularity with the show's fans, and the Chef song \"Chocolate Salty Balls\" became a number-one U.K. hit. However, when the South Park movie South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was released the following year, Chef was the only major character who did not perform a showcase song in the film; his lone musical contribution was \"Good Love,\" a track on the soundtrack album which originally appeared on Black Moses in 1971 and is not heard in the movie  In 2000, he appeared on the soundtrack of the French movie The Magnet on the song \"Is It Really Home\" written and composed by rapper Akhenaton (IAM) and composer Bruno Coulais. In 2002, Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After he played a set at the Glastonbury Festival, the same year a documentary highlighting Isaac's career and his impact on many of the Memphis artists in the 1960s onwards was produced, \"Only The Strong Survive\". In 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the Jaffa Tolok on the television series Stargate SG-1. The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed independent film Hustle & Flow. He also had a brief recurring role in UPN/The CW's Girlfriends as Eugene Childs (father of Toni).

Passage 2:\"Right Now\" was written by Blige and English musicians Sam Smith, James Napier, and brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence from electronic music duo Disclosure. Production of the song was helmed by Disclosure, while American record producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins was consulted for vocal production. \"Right Now\" was recorded at Metropolis Studios and at MusicBox Studios in London. Production of the song was motivated by \"F for You\", the fourth single from Disclosure's debut studio album, Settle (2013). In late 2013, Blige saw the duo's single their Vevo video site, and got in touch with them about covering the song. The resulting duet, largely composed by Blige, became a top ten hit on the UK Dance Chart. Inspired by its response, Blige initially hoped to record an extended play with the duo, though her label encouraged her to enhance recording overseas and soon it was announced that Blige would move to London to experiment with a new sound with a host of young British acts.  Passage 3:The 1924 World Series was the championship series of the 1924 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff, the series was played between the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators and the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants. The Senators defeated the Giants in seven games to win their first championship in club history. The Giants became the first team to play in four consecutive World Series, winning in 1921–1922 and losing in 1923–1924. Their long-time manager, John McGraw, made his ninth and final World Series appearance in 1924. The contest concluded with the second World Series-deciding game which ran to extra innings (the first had occurred in 1912). Later, the Senators would reorganize as the Minnesota Twins, again winning the World Series in 1987 and in 1991.", "answer": "3"}

Since 2004, Bundchen has been among the highest-paid models in the world, and as of 2007 was the 16th richest woman in the entertainment industry.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   An unidentified environmental reservoir of infectivity contributes to the natural transmission of prion diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [TSEs]) in sheep, deer, and elk. Prion infectivity may enter soil environments via shedding from diseased animals and decomposition of infected carcasses. Burial of TSE-infected cattle, sheep, and deer as a means of disposal has resulted in unintentional introduction of prions into subsurface environments. We examined the potential for soil to serve as a TSE reservoir by studying the interaction of the disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) with common soil minerals. In this study, we demonstrated substantial PrPSc adsorption to two clay minerals, quartz, and four whole soil samples. We quantified the PrPSc-binding capacities of each mineral. Furthermore, we observed that PrPSc desorbed from montmorillonite clay was cleaved at an N-terminal site and the interaction between PrPSc and Mte was strong, making desorption of the protein difficult. Despite cleavage and avid binding, PrPSc bound to Mte remained infectious. Results from our study suggest that PrPSc released into soil environments may be preserved in a bioavailable form, perpetuating prion disease epizootics and exposing other species to the infectious agent.", "answer": "Prions Adhere to Soil Minerals and Remain Infectious"}

His parents were Hadji Kalla, a local businessman and Athirah, a woman who sold Buginese silk for a living. He was the second of 10 children. After completing school, Kalla attended Hasanuddin University in Makassar. Section: Road to Vice Presidency Passage: Now a popular figure for assisting with the peace process in Sulawesi, Kalla considered putting himself forward as a candidate in the 2004 presidential elections. In August 2003 he announced his candidacy and enlisted as a participant in Golkar's 2004 Convention which would choose the Golkar candidate for president. As the months went by, however, Kalla came to be seen more as a vice presidential candidate. He was expected to partner a Javanese presidential candidate and his non-Javanese background was seen as a means of attracting non-Javanese votes which a Javanese candidate might have trouble getting.  Just days before the Golkar national convention, Kalla decided to withdraw from running under the Golkar banner. Rather, he accepted the offer from the Democratic Party's (PD) Yudhoyono to become his running mate. The pair also received the support of the Crescent Star Party (PBB), the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party (PKPI), and Reform Star Party (PBR).  On 5 July 2004 the presidential election was held. Yudhoyono and Kalla won the popular vote with 33% of the votes but 50% of votes is required for election as president and vice president so a run-off was required. Yudhoyono and Megawati proceeded to the second election round held later in the year.  In the second ground Yudhoyono faced a considerable challenge from Megawati who formed a national coalition consisting of her own Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P) along with Golkar, the United Development Party, the Prosperous Peace Party (PDS), and the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Whilst Yudhoyono consolidated political support from other parties, Kalla turned to Golkar for support. Led by Fahmi Idris and ignoring the party line, pro-Kalla elements in Golkar declared their support for Kalla and Yudhoyono.

{"question": "Title: Tōru Takemitsu Background: Toru Takemitsu (Wu Man  Che , Takemitsu Toru, October 8, 1930 - February 20, 1996) pronounced [takemitsW to:rW] was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. Section: Youth Passage: Takemitsu was born in Tokyo on October 8, 1930; a month later his family moved to Dalian in the Chinese province of Liaoning. In 1938 he returned to Japan to attend elementary school, but his education was cut short by military conscription in 1944. Takemitsu described his experience of military service at such a young age, under the Japanese Nationalist government, as \"... extremely bitter\". Takemitsu first became really conscious of Western classical music during his term of military service, in the form of a popular French Song (\"Parlez-moi d'amour\") which he listened to with colleagues in secret, played on a gramophone with a makeshift needle fashioned from bamboo.  During the post-war U.S. occupation of Japan, Takemitsu worked for the U.S. Armed Forces, but was ill for a long period. Hospitalised and bed-ridden, he took the opportunity to listen to as much Western music as he could on the U.S. Armed Forces network. While deeply affected by these experiences of Western music, he simultaneously felt a need to distance himself from the traditional music of his native Japan. He explained much later, in a lecture at the New York International Festival of the Arts, that for him Japanese traditional music \"always recalled the bitter memories of war\".  Despite his almost complete lack of musical training, and taking inspiration from what little Western music he had heard, Takemitsu began to compose in earnest at the age of 16: \"... I began [writing] music attracted to music itself as one human being. Being in music I found my raison d'etre as a man. After the war, music was the only thing. Choosing to be in music clarified my identity.\" Though he studied briefly with Yasuji Kiyose beginning in 1948, Takemitsu remained largely self-taught throughout his musical career. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where did he grow up? Answer: Takemitsu was born in Tokyo on October 8, 1930; a month later his family moved to Dalian in the Chinese province of Liaoning. Question: Did he have any siblings? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: What was his family life like? Answer: family moved to Dalian in the Chinese province of Liaoning.

{"question": "Use a disfluent question or a proper question and find the answer to the question based on the given context or return None if an answer can't be found. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing. A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.   proper question: What has happened to sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive rock in the Grand Canyon?   disfluent question: What has happened to sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive rock in northwestern Canada or no make that in the Grand Canyon?   context: All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Title: Richard III of England Background: Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \"Wars of the Roses\", a period of \"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\"Yorkists\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\"Lancastrians\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Section: Reburial and tomb Passage: In 1485, following his death in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field, Richard III's body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester.  Following the discoveries of Richard's remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.  His cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard's name, dates and motto (Loyaulte me lie - loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in pietra dura. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined coffin, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard's sister Anne of York, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley`s \"Looking For Richard Project\" and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society. The proposal was publicly launched by the Society on 13 February 2013 but rejected by Leicester Cathedral in favour of a memorial slab. However, following a public outcry, the Cathedral changed its position and on 18 July 2013 announced its agreement to give King Richard III a raised tomb monument.

Her mother, who was of Polish, English and Irish descent, was from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. At age 6, she performed on stage for the first time, appearing in a local talent show. Section: 1980s and Oscar win Passage: Spacek began the 1980s with an Oscar award for her role in Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), in which she played country music star Loretta Lynn, who selected her for the role. In the film, both she and Beverly D'Angelo, who played Patsy Cline, performed their own singing. Film critic Roger Ebert has credited the movie's success \"to the performance by Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. With the same sort of magical chemistry she's shown before, when she played the high school kid in Carrie, Spacek at 29 has the ability to appear to be almost any age on screen. Here, she ages from about 14 to somewhere in her 30s, always looks the age, and never seems to be wearing makeup.\" Spacek also was nominated for a Grammy Award for her singing on the film's soundtrack album. She followed this with her own country album, Hangin' Up My Heart (1983); the album spawned one hit single, \"Lonely But Only For You\", a song written by K. T. Oslin, which reached No. 15 on the Billboard Country chart.  In the film Heart Beat (1980), Spacek played Carolyn Cassady, who slipped (under the influence of John Heard's Jack Kerouac and Nick Nolte's Neal Cassady) into a combination of drudgery and debauchery. Spacek was so adamant about getting the role, that she pored through over 4,000 pages of research to prepare for her character. Producer Ed Pressman and director John Byrum took her to dinner to advise her that she did not have the role. Spacek was so distraught at the news that she shattered a glass of wine in her hand. After that, Pressman walked up to Spacek with a piece of shattered glass and told her she had the role. He said that Spacek breaking the glass clinched the deal, and they believed she would ultimately best suit the part. The film was released on April 25, 1980 to mixed critical reviews.  Also in the 1980s, Spacek starred alongside Jack Lemmon in Constantin Costa-Gavras's political thriller Missing (1982, based on the book The Execution of Charles Horman) and appeared with Mel Gibson in the rural drama The River (1984), and with Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange in 1986's Crimes of the Heart (1986). She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for all of these roles. Other performances of the decade included star turns in husband Jack Fisk's directorial debut Raggedy Man (1981) and alongside Anne Bancroft in the suicide-themed drama 'night, Mother (1986).

A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing.

This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if  is composite (with a and b ≠ 1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most . For example, for , the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to  is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.", "answer": ""}
{"question": "Title: Harry Price Background: Although Price claimed his birth was in Shropshire he was actually born in London in Red Lion Square on the site of the South Place Ethical Society's Conway Hall. He was educated in New Cross, first at Waller Road Infants School and then Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School. At 15, Price founded the Carlton Dramatic Society and wrote plays, including a drama, about his early experience with a poltergeist which he said took place at a haunted manor house in Shropshire. According to Richard Morris, in his recent biography Harry Price: Section: Rosalie Passage: Price claimed to have attended a private seance on 15 December 1937 in which a small six-year-old girl called Rosalie appeared. Price wrote he controlled the room by placing starch powder over the floor, locking the door and taping the windows before the seance. However, the identity of the sitters, or the locality where the seance was held was not revealed due to the alleged request of the mother of the child. During the seance Price claimed a small girl emerged, she spoke and he took her pulse. Price was suspicious that the supposed spirit of the child was no different than a human being but after the seance had finished the starch powder was undisturbed and none of the seals had been removed on the window. Price was convinced no one had entered the room via door or window during the seance. Price's Fifty Years of Psychical Research (1939) describes his experiences at the sitting and includes a diagram of the seance room.  Eric Dingwall and Trevor Hall wrote the Rosalie seance was fictitious and Price had lied about the whole affair but had based some of the details on the description of the house from a sitting he attended at a much earlier time in Brockley, South London where he used to live. K. M. Goldney who had criticized Price over his investigation into Borley Rectory wrote after the morning of the Rosalie sitting she found Price \"shaken to the core by his experience.\" Goldney believed Price had told the truth about the seance and informed the Two Worlds spiritualist weekly newspaper that she believed the Rosalie sitting to be genuine.  In 1985, Peter Underwood published a photograph of part of an anonymous letter that was sent to the SPR member David Cohen in the 1960s which claimed to be from a seance sitter who attended the seance. The letter confessed to having impersonated the Rosalie child in the sitting by the request of the father who had owed the mother of the child money. In 2017, Paul Adams published details of the location of the Rosalie seance and identities of the family involved. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Who was Rosalie?

{"question": "Title: The Osmonds Background: The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career. The Osmond Brothers began as a barbershop quartet consisting of brothers Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay Osmond. They were later joined by younger siblings Donny and Jimmy, both of whom enjoyed success as solo artists as well. With the addition of Donny, the group became known as The Osmonds, and enjoyed its greatest success as both a boy band and a hard rock ensemble. Section: Pop music success (1971-1972) Passage: Record producer Mike Curb saw the Osmonds perform as a band and recognized that they combined a rare mix of polished performing style, instrumental skill, and vocal talent. He helped the Osmonds get a record contract with MGM and arranged for them to record at Muscle Shoals with R&B producer Rick Hall. Under Hall's guidance, the Osmonds hit the top spot on the pop chart with \"One Bad Apple\" in 1971. The song, \"One Bad Apple\", written by George Jackson, who had The Jackson Five in mind when he wrote it, was originally presented to Motown Record's Chairman of the Board, Berry Gordy, for The Jackson Five to record, but he turned it down. It was then presented to MGM Records for The Osmonds; both the Jackson Five (who were admittedly inspired by The Osmonds' early success) and the Osmonds were aiming for the same Bubblegum sound and style of music, and it became their first number-one hit single, released on November 14, 1970.

{"question": "Title: Osceola Background: Osceola was named Billy Powell at birth in 1804 in the Creek village of Talisi. now known as Tallassee, Alabama, in current Elmore County. \"The people in the town of Tallassee...were mixed-blood Native American/English/Irish/Scottish, and some were black. Billy was all of these.\" Section: 1830s resistance and war leader Passage: Through the 1820s and the turn of the decade, American settlers kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this.  Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden to carry arms.  Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for a two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.  On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed Wiley Thompson. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, over 100 troops, marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in what Americans called the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks began the Second Seminole War. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was Osceola's role in the resistance?

{"question": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred.   In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old-fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift â an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who believes that he is an actual space ranger.Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring only one toy along. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk, but ends up knocking him out a window instead, resulting in the other toys accusing Woody of murdering Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact punishment, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well, and the two fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are picked out by Andy's destructive neighbor Sid Phillips.Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz, finally discovering he is a toy, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next morning, Woody and Sid's mutant toy creations rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him. Woody and Buzz then leave Sid's house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives chase. Woody tries rescuing Buzz with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC pick up Woody and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy.On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile., Question: What does Buzz do when the batteries on RC run out?", "answer": "Answer: He lights the rocket on his back."}

{"question": "Title: Garth Hudson Background: Eric Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937) is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist. As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Section: The Band: 1965-1976 Passage: Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums).  In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \"electric\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes.  By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \"Chest Fever\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \"The Genetic Method\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \"Rockin Chair\", from \"The Band\"; the traditional \"Ain't No More Cane\", from \"The Basement Tapes\"; Dylan's \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\"; and Bobby Charles's \"Down South in New Orleans\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \"Tears of Rage\" (from Big Pink) and \"Unfaithful Servant\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \"Ophelia\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments.  Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \"Up on Cripple Creek\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians.  After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What happened in 1965? Answer: Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads Question: When did he join the band?

Question: Where did the  local resident Dr. who captured several marauding British Army deserters from the passing army of General General Robert Ross go to medical school? Passage:During the war, an incident occurred involving the Prince George's County jail, when local resident Dr. William Beanes, (1775–1824) captured several marauding British Army deserters from the passing army of General General Robert Ross (1766–1814) and Vice Admiral, Sir George Cockburn, (1772–1853), and held them in the County Jail, after he had treated several wounded \"Redcoat\" soldiers in their march on to Washington and the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg on the Eastern Branch stream of the Anacostia River in August 1814. Later he was arrested along with several others including Robert Bowie, former 11th Governor of Maryland (1803–06, 1811–12) by retreating British cavalry on orders from Ross who had stayed in his home as headquarters. Later Francis Scott Key (1779–1843), a Georgetown and Frederick lawyer with Col. John S. Skinner, U.S. Prisoner-of-War and Parole Agent went to Baltimore secured a small sailing ship, the Minden, and sailed down the Patapsco River and the Chesapeake Bay to find the British Royal Navy fleet after leaving the Patuxent River, beating up the Bay from their base on Tangier Island, Virginia heading for their attack on the hated \"nest of pirates\" - Baltimore. After being received and negotiating with General Ross, Admiral Cockburn and their superior, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, (1758–1832), and showing him some letters written by captured British wounded soldiers testifying to the fair treatment Beanes had given them and tended to them, they agreed to free him but that would be held up until they could celebrate after the Burning of Baltimore following their attack on Fort McHenry and landing troops to the east at North Point. Well, the famous story has been told, how the general was killed prior to the skirmishing at the Battle of North Point on September 12, how the advancing British under successor, Colonel Arthur Brooke led the British regiments to face the 20,000 drafted and volunteer citizens and militia under the command of Major General Samuel Smith, (1752–1839), of the Maryland Militia on the eastern heights of \"Loudenschlager's Hill\" (later known as \"Hampstead Hill\" in modern Patterson Park, between Highlandtown and Canton neighborhoods) whose dug-in fortifications and dragged cannon were so numerous that the \"Redcoats\" halted in their tracks and decided to await the shelling of the fort which guarded the entrances to the Harbor to pass into the inner port and the waterfront of Fells Point.

{"question": "Title: Matthew Boulton Background: Matthew Boulton  (; 3 September 1728 - 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt. In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment. Section: Early and family life Passage: The elder Boulton's business prospered after young Matthew's birth, and the family moved to the Snow Hill area of Birmingham, then a well-to-do neighbourhood of new houses. As the local grammar school was in disrepair Boulton was sent to an academy in Deritend, on the other side of Birmingham. At the age of 15 he left school, and by 17 he had invented a technique for inlaying enamels in buckles that proved so popular that the buckles were exported to France, then reimported to Britain and billed as the latest French developments.  On 3 March 1749 Boulton married Mary Robinson, a distant cousin and the daughter of a successful mercer, and wealthy in her own right. They lived briefly with the bride's mother in Lichfield, and then moved to Birmingham, where the elder Matthew Boulton made his son a partner at the age of 21. Though the son signed business letters \"from father and self\", by the mid-1750s he was effectively running the business. The elder Boulton retired in 1757 and died in 1759.  The Boultons had three daughters in the early 1750s, but all died in infancy. Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. Marriage with a deceased wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: \"I advise you to say nothing of your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy ... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland.\"  The union was opposed by Anne's brother Luke, who feared Boulton would control (and possibly dissipate) much of the Robinson family fortune. In 1764 Luke Robinson died, and his estate passed to his sister Anne and thus into Matthew Boulton's control.  The Boultons had two children, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. Matthew Robinson in turn had six children with two wives. His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, broadly educated and also a man of science, gained some fame posthumously for his invention of the important aeronautical flight control, the aileron. As his father before him, he also had two wives and six children. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Who is the father of Matthew? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Where was matthew born?

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   Bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract are life-threatening and present a global burden to the global community. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes are frequent colonizers of the upper respiratory tract. Imbalances through acquisition of seasonal viruses, e.g., Influenza A virus, can lead to bacterial dissemination to the lower respiratory tract, which in turn can result in severe pneumonia. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract and focus on potential experimental models suitable for mimicking this disease. Transmission of IAV and pneumonia is mainly modeled by mouse infection. Few studies utilizing ferrets, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates are also available. The knowledge gained from these studies led to important discoveries and advances in understanding these infectious diseases. Nevertheless, mouse and other infection models have limitations, especially in translation of the discoveries to humans. Here, we suggest the use of human engineered lung tissue, human ex vivo lung tissue, and porcine models to study respiratory co-infections, which might contribute to a greater translation of the results to humans and improve both, animal and human health.", "answer": "Port d'Entrée for Respiratory Infections -Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria?"}
{"question": "In this task, you are given Wikipedia articles on a range of topics as passages and a question from the passage. We ask you to answer the question by classifying the answer as 0 (False) or 1 (True)   Passage: Refractive index -- The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, and similarly the wavelength in that medium is λ = λ/n, where λ is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the frequency (f = v/λ) of the wave is not affected by the refractive index. As a result, the energy (E = h f) of the photon, and therefore the perceived color of the refracted light to a human eye which depends on photon energy, is not affected by the refraction or the refractive index of the medium. Question: does refractive index vary with colour of light", "answer": "0"}

Another city ordinance prescribed fines for persons conducting a parade in the city of Bedford without a permit. The Reverend Jim, leader of the Poor People's Association (\"PPA\"), filed appropriate papers with city officials to parade down Main Street in the city of Bedford at 1 p.m. on July 15 .

The mountain formed near the end of the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the cliffs and ridgeline of West Suffield Mountain. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut.

{"question": "Title: Dion Dublin Background: Dion Dublin (born 22 April 1969) is an English former footballer and television presenter. Born in Leicester and of Nigerian descent, he was capped four times for England. Dublin started his career as a centre-back with Norwich City, but made his name at Cambridge United as a centre-forward. He had spells with Norwich City, Cambridge United, Manchester United, Coventry City, Millwall, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Celtic. Section: Manchester United Passage: Having seen Dublin in a cup tie, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signed him for PS1 million on 7 August 1992, fighting off competition from Chelsea and Everton. Dublin was something of a surprise purchase for United, after Ferguson had tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton but lost out to Blackburn Rovers.  He scored in United's fourth Premier League game of the 1992-93 season, a last minute winner in United's first Premier league victory - 1-0 against Southampton at The Dell. However, on 2 September, he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle by Eric Young, and was out of action for six months. By the time he had recovered, however, United had signed Eric Cantona and the Frenchman was firmly established as first choice strike partner to Mark Hughes. United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner's medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League.  In the 1993-94 season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with Everton manager Howard Kendall, that would have seen Dublin moving to Goodison Park, but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through - this incident led directly to Kendall's resignation as Everton manager and Dublin ended up staying at Old Trafford until the end of the season.  He managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3-2 home win over Oldham Athletic in early April. He also managed a further goal in the Football League Cup second round first leg, as United were beaten 2-1 by Stoke City at the Victoria Ground.

{"question": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise.   Comment: I recently met a man who was a Navajo from Northern Arizona.  He asked me about the native peoples from where I live (Southern Ontario).  He also mentioned that Navajo speakers from the US Southwest have a very similar language to the native people of Northwestern Canada, and this surprised me.  I later did some reading and it seems that the Athabaskan people of what is now Canada did indeed migrate South to that area and essentially displaced the local Pueblo tribes around AD1400 (and before the Spanish arrived to the area).  I wonder how the Pueblos felt about having their agricultural culture attacked by these nomadic hunters at the time?", "answer": "Agree"}
{"question": "Title: Clay Aiken Background: Clay Aiken was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. As a young boy, Aiken sang in the Raleigh Boychoir; and, as a teenager, he sang in school choirs, church choir, musicals and local theatre productions. After high school, he sang lead with a local band, Just By Chance, co-hosting and performing with the band at \"Just by Chance and Friends\" shows in Dunn, North Carolina. He was also MC and performer at the Johnston Community College Country Showcase in Smithfield and at the North Carolina Music Connection and Hometown Music Connection shows in Garner, and Benson. Section: Faith and philosophy Passage: Aiken was born into a Baptist family. As a toddler, in 1980, he attended Leesville Baptist Church every week. According to his book, Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life, he was involved in Bible school, choir, and the youth group. The book made The New York Times Best Seller List in 2004, debuting at number two. It was written with Allison Glock and published by Random House. Barely mentioning American Idol, Aiken instead turned his focus to the people who had the most influence in his life - his mother, grandparents, siblings, teachers, and friends - and to the importance of religion in his life. He describes himself as a proud Southern Baptist who journeyed away from those roots in his late teens in search of a religion with more liberal social policies. He then returned to that church because of family and social ties although he remains at odds with the church on some issues.  When asked in a PBS Kids interview to name his idols, he responded, \"When people ask me what three people I'd like to have dinner with, living or dead, I say Jesus Christ, Mr. Rogers, and Jimmy Carter.\"  While not self-identified as a Christian music artist, Aiken was featured in Christian Music Planet as an \"American Idol Christian\" in 2004, and in a cover story, \"Clay Aiken's Balancing Act\", in the January/February 2005 issue. His pre-Idol demo albums included several selections of Contemporary Christian Music (or CCM) and gospel songs. A performance of the Commodores' \"Jesus is Love\" at the American Music Awards in 2003 earned Aiken and Ruben Studdard a standing ovation. Aiken has sung a few CCM songs at his pop concerts, and has made Christmas albums, Christmas television specials and performances, and Christmas tours essential elements of his career.  Aiken makes it clear that he is aware not everyone shares his religious beliefs and it is not his intention to press these beliefs on others. When he worked as a camp counselor at the YMCA, he challenged other camp faculty by insisting that singing \"overtly Christian songs\" was inappropriate, as some of the kids were Jewish. \"I stood firm... no child is going to have a spiritual crisis on my watch.\" His public philosophy, geared towards inclusion and service to others, reflects his stance that decisions about religion should be made at home. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where was he a MC and performer? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Where was he born and raised?

{"question": "Article: By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 22:46 EST, 13 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:49 EST, 14 August 2013 . More than two years after the city of Christchurch was brought to its knees by earthquakes, it has finally risen out of the rubble - albeit in an unusual way. The city has built the world's first cardboard cathedral after the original 132-year-old Gothic one was destroyed in the February 2011 earthquake. Much of the city's iconic buildings were flattened by the 6.3 magnitude earthquake, leaving the New Zealand's second-largest city badly scarred. Divine inspiration: The temporary cardboard cathedral has now finally opened . This photo taken on December 5, 2012 shows the fenced-off old Christchurch Cathedral missing its tower . But now at least one of the most recognisable buildings has been replaced - with a cardboard alternative. The temporary Anglican Church opened last week, with a 10-day music series called Joyfully Un-munted to herald its re-opening, RadioNZ reported. The £2million project saw a 700 capacity cathedral built using cardboard tubes. This shows some of the cardboard tubes that were used to support the new Christchurch Cathedral . Houses teeter on the edge after landslides near Christchurch, after a 6.3 earthquake devastated New Zealand's second city and surrounding towns . Japanese architect Shigeru Ban designed the new cathedral in earthquake-devastated Christchurch . Each tube weighs 120kg in the unique design by Japanese emergency architect Shigeru Ban. The triangular prism is fashioned from 98 of these interlocking cardboard tubes, The Independent reported. The temporary structure also uses timber, steel and a concrete base alongside the cardboard tubes . The new building, which has a colourful window, was delivered by Christchurch architectural firm Warren and Mahoney, the Guardian reported. Ban is an internationally-recognised architect, whose innovative work with paper has helped crisis situations. He has constructed shelters made of paper in Haiti following an earthquake that ravaged the country in 2010. He also designed homes made out of cardboard following the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, which flooded New Orleans in Louisiana and wiped away thousands of homes. The quake killed 185 people and injured countless others, leaving Christchurch reeling by the disaster. But Christchurch residents have come up with innovative and creative ways that Christchurch residents are moving on following the catastrophic quake. Other innovative ideas, dubbed Gap Fillers, are also popping up all over the city in a bid to temporarily replace and improve buildings which were damaged and destroyed in the disaster. The Crowne Plaza Hotel, which was demolished in the months after the quake, has made way for an impressive new pavillion made using more than 3,000 wooden pallets. The impressive pavillion, which opened in December, is designed to help address the city's need for new small to medium sized entertainment venues following the demolition of clubrooms and city halls. A vision: This handout illustration shows how the cardboard tubes will last for 50 years . Summarize the above article in 3 sentences.", "answer": "The city's historic Anglican cathedral has been brought back to life .

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'   CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : I'm a trans woman in her mid 20s and my gender is a big part of who I am. I've been out for a long time and I'm very open about my transition to my friends and family. I present female in public, and although I haven't had surgery, I've been on hormone therapy for years.  My relationship with my (cis) boyfriend is nearly at the 2-years mark. We're happy. But when I first met his parents, he asked me not to mention that I was trans. I agreed and he introduced me as his girlfriend. His parents had no problem using she/her pronouns and basically it's never been questioned.  Unfortunately, keeping my transition a secret makes me very anxious. Nowadays his parents and I are reasonably close. We get along well. But every time I meet them, I know I can't relax. I'm worried I might make it obvious that it's a big effort to avoid looking like a man. Or that I'll somehow reveal that their son is dating a woman who (...let's be honest...) has a penis.  Here's the difficult part: I'm not saying they aren't aware. I don't believe I \"pass\" perfectly and it's likely they've worked it out already. But my boyfriend feels that his parents wouldn't understand, and they could potentially think less of him (and me, but my relationship with his parents isn't so important). I personally believe they would be accepting, but I realise my boyfriend knows his parents better than I do. I could be wrong... I don't know.

{"question": "Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.   This vacation was quite an experience! It was the first time that my husband and I had taken our little ones on a long trip. We only went about four hours from home, but it felt like we were a world away! The car ride went more smoothly than I thought it would with a baby in the car. Granted, we did leave in the early hours of the morning, so the kids slept for a little while. We stayed in a community of rental homes in a very nice neighborhood. The house was beautiful and it met all of our needs for the trip. There was also a huge lagoon style pool on the property that we made use of during our stay. The kids had a blast swimming in it. I think the most exciting part of our trip was seeing our little girl (3) at the beach for the first time. She was just in awe of everything.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   Viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm cannot access the host nuclear capping machinery. These viruses have evolved viral methyltransferase(s) to methylate N-7 and 2'-O cap of their RNA; alternatively, they \"snatch\" host mRNA cap to form the 5' end of viral RNA. The function of 2'-O methylation of viral RNA cap is to mimic cellular mRNA and to evade host innate immune restriction. A cytoplasmic virus defective in 2'-O methylation is replicative, but its viral RNA lacks 2'-O methylation and is recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such a mutant virus could be rationally designed as a live attenuated vaccine. Here, we use Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an important mosquito-borne flavivirus, to prove this novel vaccine concept. We show that JEV methyltransferase is responsible for both N-7 and 2'-O cap methylations as well as evasion of host innate immune response. Recombinant virus completely defective in 2'-O methylation was stable in cell culture after being passaged for >30 days. The mutant virus was attenuated in mice, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and retained the engineered mutation in vivo. A single dose of immunization induced full protection against lethal challenge with JEV strains in mice. Mechanistically, the attenuation phenotype was attributed to the enhanced sensitivity of the mutant virus to the antiviral effects of interferon and IFIT proteins. Collectively, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using 2'-O methylation-defective virus as a vaccine approach; this vaccine approach should be applicable to other flaviviruses and nonflaviviruses that encode their own viral 2'-O methyltransferases.", "answer": "Rational design of a flavivirus vaccine by abolishing viral RNA 2'-O methylation."}

{"question": "Title: Jackie Gleason Background: John Herbert Gleason was born in 1916 at 364 Chauncey Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Named Herbert Walton Gleason, Jr., at birth, he was baptized John Herbert Gleason, and  grew up at 328 Chauncey (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on The Honeymooners). His parents were Herbert Walton \"Herb\" Gleason, an Irish-American insurance auditor, and Mae \"Maisie\" (nee Kelly), originally of Farranree, Cork, Ireland. Gleason was one of two children; his brother Clement J. died of meningitis at age 14. Section: Honeymooners revival Passage: Gleason did two Jackie Gleason Show specials for CBS after giving up his regular show in the 1970s, including Honeymooners segments and a Reginald Van Gleason III sketch in which the gregarious millionaire was portrayed as an alcoholic. When the CBS deal expired, Gleason signed with NBC. He later did a series of Honeymooners specials for ABC. Gleason hosted four ABC specials during the mid-1970s. Gleason and Carney also made a television movie, Izzy and Moe (1985), about an unusual pair of historic Federal prohibition agents in New York City who achieved an unbeatable arrest record with highly successful techniques including impersonsations and humor, which aired on CBS in 1985.  In April 1974, Gleason revived several of his classic characters (including Ralph Kramden, Joe the Bartender and Reginald Van Gleason III) in a television special with Julie Andrews. In a song-and-dance routine, the two performed \"Take Me Along\" from Gleason's Broadway musical.  In 1985, three decades after the \"Classic 39\" began filming, Gleason revealed he had carefully preserved kinescopes of his live 1950s programs in a vault for future use (including Honeymooners sketches with Pert Kelton as Alice). These \"lost episodes\" (as they came to be called) were initially previewed at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City, aired on the Showtime cable network in 1985, and later added to the Honeymooners syndication package. Some of them include earlier versions of plot lines later used in the 'classic 39' episodes. One (a Christmas episode duplicated several years later with Meadows as Alice) had all Gleason's best-known characters (Ralph Kramden, the Poor Soul, Rudy the Repairman, Reginald Van Gleason, Fenwick Babbitt and Joe the Bartender) featured in and out of the Kramden apartment. The storyline involved a wild Christmas party hosted by Reginald Van Gleason up the block from the Kramdens' building at Joe the Bartender's place.

Arsenal had just missed out on promotion on goal average to the First Division, and in 1914–15 King spearheaded their attack, scoring 26 goals in the League and another three in the FA Cup. These included the first hat trick scored at their new Highbury stadium (against Grimsby Town on 14 November 1914), and two four-goal hauls against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest. King's 29 goals that season were an all-time club record at the time, remaining so until Jimmy Brain broke it in 1925–26.

{"question": "Title: Manorialism Background: Manorialism was an essential element of feudal society. It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. Section: History Passage: The word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside, reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manors or seigneuries; each manor being subject to a lord (French seigneur), usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord (see Feudalism). The lord held a manorial court, governed by public law and local custom. Not all territorial seigneurs were secular; bishops and abbots also held lands that entailed similar obligations.  By extension, the word manor is sometimes used in England to mean any home area or territory in which authority is held, often in a police or criminal context.  In the generic plan of a medieval manor from Shepherd's Historical Atlas, the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent. In this plan, the manor house is set slightly apart from the village, but equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor, formerly walled, while the manor lands stretched away outside, as still may be seen at Petworth House. As concerns for privacy increased in the 18th century, manor houses were often located a farther distance from the village. For example, when a grand new house was required by the new owner of Harlaxton Manor, Lincolnshire, in the 1830s, the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one, isolated in its park, with the village out of view.  In an agrarian society, the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors. There were two legal systems of pre-manorial landholding. One, the most common, was the system of holding land \"allodially\" in full outright ownership. The other was a use of precaria or benefices, in which land was held conditionally (the root of the English word \"precarious\").  To these two systems, the Carolingian monarchs added a third, the aprisio, which linked manorialism with feudalism. The aprisio made its first appearance in Charlemagne's province of Septimania in the south of France, when Charlemagne had to settle the Visigothic refugees, who had fled with his retreating forces, after the failure of his Zaragoza expedition of 778. He solved this problem by allotting \"desert\" tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal fisc under direct control of the emperor. These holdings aprisio entailed specific conditions. The earliest specific aprisio grant that has been identified was at Fontjoncouse, near Narbonne (see Lewis, links). In former Roman settlements, a system of villas, dating from Late Antiquity, was inherited by the medieval world.

{"question": "Title: Gaelic Ireland Background: Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \"patchwork\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Section: Warfare Passage: Warfare was common in Gaelic Ireland, as territories fought for supremacy against each other and (later) against the Anglo-Normans. Champion warfare is a common theme in Irish mythology. In the Middle Ages all able-bodied men, apart from the learned and the clergy, were eligible for military service on behalf of the king or chief. Throughout the Middle Ages and for some time after, outsiders often wrote that the style of Irish warfare differed greatly from what they deemed to be the norm in Western Europe. The Gaelic Irish preferred hit-and-run raids (the crech), which involved catching the enemy unaware. If this worked they would then seize any valuables (mainly livestock) and potentially valuable hostages, burn the crops, and escape. The cattle raid was often called a Tain Bo in Gaelic literature. Although hit-and-run raiding was the preferred tactic in medieval times, there were also pitched battles. From at least the 11th century, kings maintained small permanent fighting forces known as \"troops of the household\", who were often given houses and land on the king's mensal land. These were well-equipped professional soldiers made up of infantry and cavalry. By the reign of Brian Boru, Irish kings were taking large armies on campaign over long distances and using naval forces in tandem with land forces.  A typical medieval Irish army included light infantry, heavy infantry and cavalry. The bulk of the army was made-up of light infantry called ceithern (anglicized 'kern'). The ceithern wandered Ireland offering their services for hire and usually wielded swords, skenes (a kind of long knife), short spears, bows and shields. The cavalry was usually made-up of a king or chieftain and his close relatives. They usually rode without saddles but wore armour and iron helmets and wielded swords, skenes and long spears or lances. One kind of Irish cavalry was the hobelar. After the Norman invasion there emerged a kind of heavy infantry called galloglaigh (anglicized 'gallo[w]glass'). They were originally Scottish mercenaries who appeared in the 13th century, but by the 15th century most large tuatha had their own hereditary force of Irish galloglaigh. Some Anglo-Norman lordships also began using galloglaigh in imitation of the Irish. They usually wore mail and iron helmets and wielded sparth axes, claymores, and sometimes spears or lances. The galloglaigh furnished the retreating plunderers with a \"moving line of defence from which the horsemen could make short, sharp charges, and behind which they could retreat when pursued\". As their armour made them less nimble, they were sometimes planted at strategic spots along the line of retreat. The kern, horsemen and galloglaigh had lightly-armed servants to carry their weapons into battle.  Warriors were sometimes rallied into battle by blowing horns and warpipes. According to Gerald de Barri (in the 12th century), they did not wear armour, as they deemed it burdensome to wear and \"brave and honourable\" to fight without it. Instead, most ordinary soldiers fought semi-naked and carried only their weapons and a small round shield--Spenser wrote that these shields were covered with leather and painted in bright colours. Kings and chiefs sometimes went into battle wearing helmets adorned with eagle feathers. For ordinary soldiers, their thick hair often served as a helmet, but they sometimes wore simple helmets made from animal hides. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Tell me about warfare in Gaelic Ireland.

The minister has frequently come into conflict with rescue ship operators and last month was involved in a public stand-off about the disembarkation of 150 migrants on a coast guard ship on the island of Sicily. Mr Salvini is under investigation for his role in the dispute. In a separate development, a rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean Sea has had its registration revoked by Panama leaving its future operations in jeopardy. When the Aquarius next docks, it will have to remove its Panama maritime flag and cannot set sail without a new registration, raising the possibility it may end up stuck in port. It is the last private rescue ship picking up migrants trying to cross from Libya to Europe and is currently sailing to the French port of Marseille with migrants on board. The charities running the Aquarius accuse the Italian government of pressuring Panama into deflagging it. The two groups which lease it, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and SOS Mediterranée, say they were notified of the decision by the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) on Saturday. The authority is said to have described the ship as a \"political problem\" for the country's government, and said Italian authorities had urged them to take \"immediate action\" against them, according to SOS Mediterranée. Mr Salvini, who has previously described the aid boats as a \"taxi service\" for migrants, denies his country put pressure on Panama. According to the United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018. The Aquarius has been operating in the area since February 2016, finding itself at the centre of diplomatic stand-offs in recent months over where to land rescued migrants. It was under the flag of the Gibraltar Maritime Administration until August this year, when it was given \"notice of removal\" and re-registered with Panama. The ship's operators say they were notified of the new decision while on a current mission, and say they have 58 survivors on board from two boats they found in distress. In a joint statement, the charities insisted they were in \"full compliance\" with maritime law and denounced the decision as condemning hundreds to death. The statement asks for European governments to step in to allow the vessel to continue its operations by either reassuring the Panamanian authorities or issuing it a new flag.", "answer": "The Italian government has passed a decree which will make it easier to deport migrants and strip them of Italian citizenship."}

Growing up, Lucas had a passion for cars and motor racing, which later inspired his films 1:42.08 and American Graffiti. Long before Lucas became obsessed with filmmaking, he yearned to be a race-car driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages.

The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they released their first record with Warner, \"Hit to Death in the Future Head\" (1992).

In a Priest Driven Ambulance, their first album with producer Dave Fridmann, was recorded at the State University of New York in Fredonia for $5 an hour on a $10,000 budget. The album was host to a marked expansion in the band's sound and their previous experiments in tape loops and effects were given a more prominent role. During this period, Coyne made his transition to a higher, more strained vocal style akin to Neil Young, which he first used on Telepathic Surgery's \"Chrome Plated Suicide\" and has employed ever since.

{"question": "Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.   Context: In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai. However, they flee when Imhotep's evil presence manifests itself, leaving him to die in the desert.In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, Evelyn Carnahan is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it in Thebes. The map seems to point the way to the lost city of Hamunaptra, where all of the wealth of Egypt was supposedly stored; however, the museum curator, Dr. Bey, dismisses Hamunaptra as a myth, and accidentally damages the map. Jonathan reveals he actually stole it from an American (revealed to be O'Connell), who is currently in prison, and may be able to tell more about Hamunaptra. Rick tells them that he knows the location of the city from his days in the Foreign Legion. He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. Evelyn successfully negotiates his release from the prison warden by offering him 25% of the found treasure; however, the warden insist on coming along in order to protect his investment. They board a ship to start their expedition to the city, where they encounter a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain, and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former Legion soldier who served with Rick and also knows the location of the lost city.During the journey, the boat is invaded by Medjai soldiers who are looking for Evelyn's box and the map. The expedition manages to fight them off, but the map is lost and the boat goes up in flames, forcing the entire party to go ashore. Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan are separated from the other treasure hunters and procure camels at a nearby market. Since Rick knows the way to the city, they arrive at Hamunaptra at the same time as the other party, but due to tensions between the two groups, they start exploring the city in separate locations. The Americans discover a chest between the legs of the statue of Anubis. They have it opened by several of their carriers, but the chest is booby-trapped and the carriers die from an acid spray. In the meanwhile, Evelyn is looking for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book supposedly capable of taking life away. Her team discovers a tomb buried directly below the statue of Anubis   Question: Where does the map lead?", "answer": "hamunaptra"}

{"question": "Title: Johnny Unitas Background: John Constantine Unitas was born in Pittsburgh in 1933 to Francis J. Unitas and Helen Superfisky, who both were of Lithuanian descent; he grew up in the Mount Washington neighborhood. When Johnny was five years old, his father died of cardiovascular renal disease complicated by pneumonia, leaving the young boy to be raised by his mother, who worked two jobs to support the family. His surname was a result of a phonetic transliteration of a common Lithuanian last name Jonaitis. Attending St. Justin's High School in Pittsburgh, Unitas played halfback and quarterback. Section: Baltimore Colts Passage: In 1956, Unitas joined the Baltimore Colts of the NFL under legendary coach Weeb Ewbank, after being asked at the last minute to join Bloomfield Rams lineman Jim Deglau, a Croatian steel worker with a life much like Unitas', at the latter's scheduled Colts tryout. The pair borrowed money from friends to pay for the gas to make the trip. Deglau later told a reporter after Unitas' death, \"[His] uncle told him not to come. [He] was worried that if he came down and the Colts passed on him, it would look bad (to other NFL teams).\" The Colts signed Unitas, much to the chagrin of the Cleveland Browns, who had hoped to claim the rejected Steeler quarterback.  Unitas made his NFL debut with an inauspicious \"mop-up\" appearance against Detroit, going 0-2 with one interception. Two weeks later, starting quarterback George Shaw suffered a broken leg against the Chicago Bears. In his first serious action, Unitas' initial pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. Then he botched a hand-off on his next play, a fumble recovered by the Bears. Unitas rebounded quickly from that 58-27 loss, leading the Colts to an upset of Green Bay and their first win over Cleveland. He threw nine touchdown passes that year, including one in the season finale that started his record 47-game streak. His 55.6-percent completion mark was a rookie record.  In 1957, his first season as the Colts full-time starter at quarterback, Unitas finished first in the NFL in passing yards (2,550) and touchdown passes (24) as he helped lead the Colts to a 7-5 record, the first winning record in franchise history. At season's end, Unitas received the Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA). CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did he join the Colts?

The aim of this study was to evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in preventing pediatric influenza infections. Methods: Laboratory confirmed influenza cases occurred during 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons matched by age and date of consultation. NPI (frequency of hand washing, alcohol-based hand sanitizer use and hand washing after touching contaminated surfaces) during seven days prior to onset of symptoms were obtained from parents of cases and controls. Results: Cases presented higher prevalence of underlying conditions such as pneumonia [OR = 3.23; 95 % CI: 1.38 -7.58 p = 0.007], asthma [OR = 2.45; 95 % CI: 1.17 -5.14 p = 0.02] and having more than 1 risk factor [OR = 1.67; 95 % CI: 0.99 -2.82 p = 0.05]. Hand washing more than 5 times per day [aOR = 0.62; 95 % CI: 0.39 -0.99 p = 0.04] was the only statistically significant protective factor. When considering two age groups (pre-school age 0-4 yrs and school age 5-17) yrs , only the school age group showed a negative association for influenza infection for both washing more than 5 times per day [aOR = 0.47; 95 % CI: 0.22 -0.99 p = 0.04] and hand washing after touching contaminated surfaces [aOR = 0.19; 95 % CI: 0.04 -0.86 p = 0.03]. Conclusion: Frequent hand washing should be recommended to prevent influenza infection in the community setting and in special in the school age group.", "answer": "Effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures in preventing pediatric influenza: a case-control study the CIBERESP Cases and Controls in Pandemic Influenza Working Group, Spain"}
{"question": "Title: Benjamin Tillman Background: Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847 - July 3, 1918) was a politician of the Democratic Party who served as Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 until his death in 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign. In the 1880s, Tillman, a wealthy landowner, became dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. Section: Inauguration and legislative control Passage: Tillman was sworn in as governor in Columbia on December 4, 1890, before a crowd of jubilant supporters, the largest to see South Carolina's governor inaugurated since Hampton's swearing-in. In his inaugural address, Tillman celebrated his victory, \"the citizens of this great commonwealth have for the first time in its history demanded and obtained for themselves the right to choose her Governor; and I, as the exponent and leader of the revolution which brought about the change, am here to take the solemn oath of office ... the triumph of democracy and white supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy, of civilization over barbarism, has been most complete.\"  Tillman made it clear he was not content that African Americans were allowed even a limited role in the political life of South Carolina:  The whites have absolute control of the State government, and we intend at any and all hazards to retain it. The intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage ... is as yet beyond the capacity of the vast majority of colored men. We deny, without regard to color, that \"all men are created equal\"; it is not true now, and was not true when Jefferson wrote it.  The legislature, at Tillman's recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing Charleston County four of its twelve seats, and other lowcountry counties one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut.  Among the matters before the new, Tillman-controlled legislature was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891--until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There was a call from many in the South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had played a major role in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator's neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), \"to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman's act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton was a living symbol\".

{"question": "In how many ways can a convex polygon with 8 sides be divided into triangles by connecting its vertices, with no intersecting lines? Relevant Theorem: The Catalan-Mingantu numbers, also known as the Catalan numbers, are a sequence of natural numbers that have various applications in combinatorial mathematics, including counting certain types of lattice paths, the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses that are correctly matched, and the number of ways to triangulate a polygon with n+2 sides.  The Catalan numbers can be defined recursively as follows:  C(0) = 1 C(n) = Σ [C(i) * C(n-i-1)] for i = 0 to n-1, where n ≥ 1  Alternatively, they can be defined using the binomial coefficient:  C(n) = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n choose n) = (2n)! / [(n + 1)! * n!]  The first few Catalan numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, and so on.  The term \"Mingantu\" in the name \"Catalan-Mingantu numbers\" refers to the Mongolian mathematician Mingantu, who independently discovered the sequence in the 18th century.

{"question": "Title: Testament (band) Background: Testament is an American thrash metal band from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band's current lineup comprises guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, lead vocalist Chuck Billy, drummer Gene Hoglan, and bassist Steve Di Giorgio. Since its inception, Testament has had numerous lineup changes, leaving Peterson as the only constant member. Billy replaced original singer Steve \"Zetro\" Souza (who left the band to join Exodus as the replacement of Paul Baloff) in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since. Section: Increasing popularity (1988-1992) Passage: Testament's second album, The New Order, was released in May 1988, and found the band continuing in a similar vein. The album was a minor success, peaking at number 136 on the Billboard 200, and managed to sell over 250,000 copies. In support of The New Order, Testament opened for Megadeth on their So Far, So Good... So What! tour in Europe, and toured the United States with the likes of Death Angel, Vio-Lence and Raven.  After touring in support of The New Order, the band headed back into the studio to record their third studio album Practice What You Preach. Released in August 1989, the album minimized the occult and gothic themes found in the lyrical content of their first two albums, instead focusing on real-life issues such as politics and corruption. Practice What You Preach performed better on the charts than The New Order, reaching at number 77 on the Billboard 200, and included the hit single, the title track, which saw extensive airplay on Headbangers Ball. Testament toured for nearly a year behind Practice What You Preach with several bands, including Annihilator, Wrathchild America, Mortal Sin, Nuclear Assault and Savatage. By 1990, the album had sold over 450,000 copies.  In October 1990, Testament released their fourth studio album Souls of Black. Although reviews were mixed, the album managed to sell respectably, in no doubt largely off the strength of the single title track, and saw the band perform on arena tours, including the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies. They also opened for Judas Priest on their Painkiller tour from October to December 1990, and Slayer on their Seasons in the Abyss tour from January to March 1991.  Attempting to reconnect with an audience distracted by the growing grunge movement, Testament released The Ritual in 1992. The Ritual saw a stylistic move away from thrash to a slower, slightly more traditional heavy metal sound. The Ritual peaked at 55 on the Billboard Hot 100, the band's highest chart position at the time, and the power ballad \"Return to Serenity\" managed to receive radio airplay, peaking at number 22. In support of the album, Testament toured Europe and North America, headlining their own tours, as well as opening for Iron Maiden on their Fear of the Dark tour, and Black Sabbath on their Dehumanizer tour. However, the success of The Ritual did not put an end to the tensions within the band. CANNOTANSWER  Question: How did the band increase their popularity? Answer: In support of The New Order, Testament opened for Megadeth on their So Far, So Good... Question: When did they do that? Answer: Testament's second album, The New Order, was released in May 1988, Question: What happened in 1989?

Question: In which year did an album with Garron playing bass finally get released? Passage 1:In June 1998, Norwood released her second album Never Say Never. Boosted by the success of its number-one lead single \"The Boy Is Mine\", a duet with singer Monica, it facilitated Norwood in becoming a viable recording artist with media–crossing appeal. In total, the album sold 16 million copies worldwide and spawned seven singles, including Norwood's second number-one song, the Diane Warren-penned \"Have You Ever?\". Also in 1998, Norwood made her big screen debut in a supporting role in the slasher sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, which garnered her both a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Female Performance. The following year, she co-starred with Diana Ross in the telefilm drama Double Platinum about an intense, strained relationship between a mother and daughter. Both Norwood and Ross served as executive producers of the movie which features original songs from Never Say Never and Ross's Every Day Is a New Day (1999).  Passage 2:After the release of Levitate, his first full-length album, in 2011, he began to play shows and festivals around the country. Starting in 2012 with a US tour that saw him hit the road with The M Machine, he continued on to play the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, more commonly known as Coachella, a festival that takes place in April in Indio, California. After Coachella he played Electric Forest Festival in Rothbury, Michigan in June 2012. He then played Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago, Illinois Grant Park (Chicago) in early August 2012 before Heading to New York City to play Electric Zoo Festival at the end of August 2012 on Randall's Island.

{"question": "Title: The Wildhearts Background: The Wildhearts are an English rock group, formed in 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as The Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. However, this characterization is denied by the band, who see their influences as being far broader, as shown in the song \"29 X The Pain\", which lists many of group leader Ginger's influences. Despite several top 20 singles and one top 10 album in Britain, the Wildhearts have not achieved major commercial success, owing in part to difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to recreational drugs and depression. Section: Early years Passage: The Wildhearts formed in late 1989, after Ginger was sacked from the Quireboys. An often-told story from this time period is that Ginger decided to start his own band after falling down a flight of stairs with a bottle of Jack Daniel's but emerging with the bottle intact. Had the bottle smashed, he would have slit his wrists with the shards, but instead he resolved to form a band in which he could exercise his songwriting skills, rather than just playing guitar as in his previous bands. Throughout the band's career, Ginger has written almost all the songs himself.  Initially called the Wild Hearts (two words), the band originally included singers Snake (ex-Tobruk) and Dunken F. Mullett (ex-Mournblade), who both joined for short periods. Nine demos were recorded in 1989 and 1990 with Snake singing on four and Dunken on five. These demos remain unreleased and displayed a sound resembling Guns N' Roses, with the Wildhearts sound still to be developed. Some of the demos were produced by Ric Browde and intended for an EP release that never materialized, though these demos are occasionally found on unofficial releases. In March 1991, Ginger reluctantly took over on lead vocals despite his reservations, as he has never thought himself a good singer.  After many early personnel changes, the line-up solidified around Ginger on guitar and vocals, CJ (Christopher Jagdhar) on guitar and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Dogs D'Amour drummer Bam. This line-up released two EPs in 1992, Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go and Don't Be Happy...Just Worry. CANNOTANSWER  Question: How did the band members get together?

{"question": "Title: The Birthday Party (band) Background: The Birthday Party (originally known as The Boys Next Door) were an Australian post-punk band, active from 1978 to 1983. Despite limited commercial success, The Birthday Party's influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called \"one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early '80s.\" The group's \"bleak and noisy soundscapes,\" which drew irreverently on blues, free jazz, and rockabilly, provided the setting for vocalist Nick Cave's disturbing tales of violence and perversion. Their music has been described by critic Simon Reynolds as gothic, and their single \"Release the Bats\" was particularly influential on the emerging gothic scene. Section: Early years and The Boys Next Door (1973-1978) Passage: The nucleus of the band first met at the private boys school Caulfield Grammar School, in suburban Melbourne, in the early seventies. A rock group was formed in 1973, with Nick Cave (vocals), Mick Harvey (guitar), and Phill Calvert (drums), with other students John Cocivera, Brett Purcell and Chris Coyne (on guitar, bass and saxophone respectively). Most were also members of the school choir. The band played under various names at parties and school functions with a mixed repertoire of David Bowie, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, Alice Cooper and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, among others.  After their final school year in 1975 the band decided to continue as a four-piece group, with friend Tracy Pew picking up the bass. Greatly affected by the punk explosion of 1976 which saw Australian bands The Saints and Radio Birdman making their first recordings and tours, The Boys Next Door, as they were now called, began performing punk and proto-punk cover versions, such as \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Gloria\", and a few original songs. By November 1977 their set was dominated by fast original new wave material, such as \"Sex Crimes\" and \"Masturbation Generation\".  The Boys' second guitarist, Rowland S. Howard, joined in 1978, and about this time, the group's sound changed dramatically. The addition of Howard's guitar was certainly a catalyst (his later use of audio feedback being a hallmark of the group) but there were other changes, as well: their sound drew upon punk, rockabilly, free jazz and the rawest blues, but defied concise categorization. Many songs were driven by prominent, repetitive basslines and frenetic, yet minimalist, drumming. Though the band was tightly rehearsed, the instrumentalists often sounded as if they were on the verge of collapse, this quality only emphasising the newfound mania of Cave's singing, and his expressionist lyrics. In producer/engineer Tony Cohen they found a willing accomplice to their experimentation and their refusal to repeat themselves; and in manager Keith Glass they found an enthusiastic financial backer. Glass' label Missing Link Records released all of the early Birthday Party records. CANNOTANSWER  Question: How many were in the band? Answer: Nick Cave (vocals), Mick Harvey (guitar), and Phill Calvert (drums), with other students John Cocivera, Brett Purcell and Chris Coyne (on guitar, bass and saxophone respectively).

{"question": "Title: Nelson Piquet Background: Nelson Piquet Souto Maior (Portuguese pronunciation: ['newso pi'ke], born August 17, 1952), known as Nelson Piquet, is a Brazilian former racing driver and businessman. Since his retirement, Piquet has been ranked among the greatest Formula One drivers in various motorsport polls. Piquet had a brief career in tennis before losing interest in the sport and subsequently took up karting and hid his identity to prevent his father discovering his hobby. He became the Brazilian national karting champion in 1971-72 and won the Formula Vee championship in 1976. Section: Lotus (1988-89) Passage: Nelson Piquet and the number 1 went to a stagnating Lotus team in 1988, and his career took a nose dive despite the Camel sponsored Lotus 100T having the same specification Honda V6 turbo that powered the McLarens of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Nelson, who had 20 wins and 3 World Championships following the 1987 season, began to lose his reputation when he had no wins in 1988, losing his number one status to fellow Brazilian Senna, who won 8 races and the championship for McLaren (Prost won 7 races, while Piquet could only manage three 3rd-place finishes for the season).  In early 1988 he resorted to using the media to attack his rivals and gained a reputation as an outspoken \"loose cannon\", such as attacking Mansell and his wife, calling Mansell \"an uneducated blockhead\" (and insulting his wife's looks), and calling fellow Senna \"the Sao Paulo taxi driver\" and stating that he \"doesn't like women\". Piquet retracted his comments when both threatened legal action. He also earned the ire of the Tifosi at the San Marino Grand Prix when he said in an interview with Playboy that Scuderia Ferrari might do better as a team if the boss (Enzo Ferrari) was a younger man instead of the 90-year-old one who rarely attended races due to his age and failing health. Piquet claims he was badly misquoted in the interview, which also had him questioning Alain Prost's standing as the best driver in the world. On the official FIA video review of the 1988 season, Piquet left no doubts that the article got it wrong in his comments about Ferrari (saying that at 90, Enzo Ferrari had to be a strong man to run a Formula One team), and that he considered Prost to be the world's best driver.  Piquet had a dismal 1989 season, driving a Judd V8-powered Lotus which had 125 less hp than the Honda V10s used by McLaren. He (and teammate Satoru Nakajima) once again had no wins and they both even failed to qualify for the 1989 Belgian Grand Prix, Piquet's first non-qualification since the 1982 Detroit Grand Prix. On what was his last attempt to qualify at Spa, Piquet lost his chance when he was slowed by rookie Frenchman Olivier Grouillard, who had gained a reputation throughout the season as a blocker.

{"question": "Title: Sydney Barnes Background: Sydney Francis Barnes (19 April 1873 - 26 December 1967) was an English professional cricketer who is generally regarded as one of the greatest ever bowlers. He was right-handed and bowled at a pace that varied from medium to fast-medium with the ability to make the ball both swing and break from off or leg. He is the quickest bowler to achieve 150 Test wickets in history. Barnes was unusual in that, despite a very long career as a top-class player, he spent little more than two seasons in first-class cricket, representing Warwickshire and Lancashire. Section: 1888 to 1894 Passage: Barnes' career began in 1888 when he was fifteen and played for a small club which had a ground behind the Galton Hotel in Smethwick. Soon afterwards, he joined Smethwick Cricket Club and played for its third team. He was taught to bowl off spin by Billy Bird, the Smethwick professional who had played for Warwickshire, and then taught himself to bowl leg spin. In due course, he was selected for the second team and had earned a place in the first team, playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League, at the start of the 1893 season.  In 1894, when Barnes was a 21-year-old fast bowler, he was asked to join the ground staff of Staffordshire County Cricket Club but he found the terms unattractive. Instead, he joined Rishton Cricket Club in the Lancashire League where the pay was better than in any form of county cricket, largely because of match bonuses and collections. Wilfrid S. White commented that Barnes' career in league cricket \"stands out unparalleled, unapproached, by any other player\".  Later in the 1894 season, Barnes was invited to play for Warwickshire, who were due to enter the County Championship in 1895. His debut was in a minor match against Cheshire at Edgbaston on 20-21 August. Barnes bowled only 8 overs, taking none for 27, and the match was drawn. On 23 August, Barnes made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground, except that he did not take the field as play was restricted by bad weather to just 72 overs of his team's first innings, in which they reached 102-2.

{"question": "Article: Many new mothers turn to the Internet to answer questions or concerns about life with their newborn. Sleeping habits are, of course, top of the list of queries but general health worries and child development are also popular online search topics, according to a new study out today. The most common three questions googled by mothers are: 'How can I get my child to sleep more?', 'How to clear my baby's nose?' and 'How can I help a teething baby?'. Two thirds of new mothers questioned in a parenting survey described Google as their 'best friend' during the early stages of motherhood . Almost two thirds of the mothers questioned described Google as their 'best friend' during the early stages of motherhood. It also emerged that as many as 85 per cent of mothers felt they had no idea what they were doing after giving birth to their first child. And almost three quarters described having a baby as the 'biggest shock of their life'. The study of 2,000 mothers found that 82 per cent felt constantly worried about their child. And to put their mind at ease during their pregnancy and in the weeks and months after giving birth three quarters admitted to regularly turning to Google for answers to any questions or worries they had. Common questions include: 'How do I treat a baby's cold?', 'When should I wean my baby?', 'How much milk should my baby have?' and 'Is my baby's rash normal?'. Common online searches include: 'How do I treat a baby's cold?', 'When should I wean my baby?', 'How much milk should my baby have?' and 'Is my baby's rash normal?'. The list also included questions such as 'What is colic?', 'How and when to potty train my child?', and 'When should my child crawl or walk?'. As well as googling answers to their questions, the study also found 26 per cent of mothers have asked friends for advice on Facebook, while another 12 per cent have turned to Twitter. Just over half have browsed parenting sites for the answers they are looking for, with 19 per cent also posting their question on parenting forums. Researchers found for some the questions start immediately, with more than one in ten turning to Google on the day they found they were expecting. Another 17 per cent did so within a few days of a positive test result. One in twenty even searched the internet to answer a question they had on the day they gave birth. But 87 per cent of mothers found they worried less as time went on and they adjusted to becoming a mum. And eight in ten spent less time googling things and worrying with second or third children. A spokesperson for Cussons Mum&Me Voice of Mums, which commissioned the research, said: 'Becoming a mum is a massive life-changing event, and it's natural to feel unsure or apprehensive at times. 'The study results show that while mothers often feel like the only one in the world worrying about a particular thing, more often than not it's something really common that most mums will have experienced and asked for advice on. 'When you first bring your baby home, it can feel pretty daunting knowing you are responsible for this little person, who doesn't come with an instruction manual. 'This can be especially true when dealing with their first cold or illness. 'But every mum you know will have been there, so you don't need to feel alone about asking them for advice.' As well as googling answers to their questions, the study also found 26 per cent of mothers have asked friends for advice on Facebook, while another 12 per cent have turned to Twitter . 1.

The subjects were divided into two groups with or without a progression of DR. The mean HbA1c and mean GA were calculated separately by the sum of all measured values divided by the numbers of values throughout the study period.', 'Of the 359 subjects, progression group showed significantly higher diabetes duration (8.41±5.72 vs. 6.46±5.77, P<0.01), baseline HbA1c (9.13±2.71 vs. 8.41±2.32, P<0.05), fasting plasma glucose (8.71±2.78 vs. 7.94±2.63, P<0.05), 2h-postprandial glucose (15.12±11.20 vs.13.14±4.72, P<0.05), eGFR (114.81±39.15 vs. 103.23±32.18, P<0.01), mean HbA1c (8.32±1.69 vs. 7.39±1.35, P<0.01) and mean GA (22.66±5.92 vs. 19.83±5.18, P<0.01) than non-progression group.

{"question": "Title: Ethel Merman Background: Merman was born in her maternal grandmother's house located at 359 4th Avenue in Astoria, Queens in New York City in 1908, though she would later emphatically insist that it was actually 1912. Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879-1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883-1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Section: Later life and death Passage: Merman began to become forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles to appear on the 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma. The New York Times reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live). The tumor caused Merman to become aphasic, and, as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, \"Mom truly appreciated [her fans'] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal--she drew lines, and she could cut you off.\"  Merman's health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman's remains were given to her son Robert, Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel.  On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theatre memorabilia, earned in excess of $120,000 at Christie's East. The 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" in tribute to Merman.

{"question": "Title: Joseph Merrick Background: Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 - 11 April 1890), often incorrectly called John Merrick, was an English man with very severe face and body deformities who was first exhibited at a freak show as the \"Elephant Man\", and then went to live at the London Hospital after he met Frederick Treves, subsequently becoming well known in London society. Merrick was born in Leicester, and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life: his skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed enlarged lips, a bony lump grew on his forehead, one of his arms and both of his feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 9, his mother died from bronchopneumonia, and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at the age of 13 and had difficulty finding employment. Section: Employment and the workhouse Passage: Merrick left school aged 13, which was usual for the time. His home-life was now \"a perfect misery\", and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection towards him. He ran away \"two or three\" times, but was brought back by his father each time. At 13, he found work rolling cigars in a factory, but after three years, his right hand deformity had worsened and he no longer had the dexterity required for the job. Now unemployed, he spent his days wandering the streets, looking for work and avoiding his stepmother's taunts.  Merrick was becoming a greater financial burden on his family, and eventually his father secured him a hawker's licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door. This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.  Merrick was now homeless on the streets of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester for the next two years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.  Merrick became one of 1,180 residents in the workhouse. Joseph was given a classification to determine his place of accommodation. The class system determined which department or ward he would reside as well as the amounts of food he would receive. Joseph was classed as class one for able bodied males and females. On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed himself out of the workhouse and spent two days looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years. Around 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8-9 inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat. He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had a large part of the mass removed. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Did his first job involve his deformities? Answer: he found work rolling cigars in a factory, Question: Did he work there long? Answer: after three years, his right hand deformity had worsened and he no longer had the dexterity required for the job. Question: What was his second job?

The finish of the race was dominated by overseas challengers as Melodist won by one and a half lengths from her fellow British raider Asl (previously second in the Musidora Stakes) with the French-trained Summer Trip a neck away in third. On 9 July Melodist was one of nine runners to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh and started at odds of 11/1. The 2/9 favourite for the race was Diminuendo, ridden by Steve Cauthen, who had won The Oaks by four lengths. Both Melodist and Diminuendo were owned by Sheikh Mohammed and based at Newmarket, but whereas Melodist was trained by Stoute, the favourite was trained by Henry Cecil at Warren Place. The other fancied runners were Dancing Goddess (second in the Irish 1000 Guineas), Miss Boniface (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Silver Lane (Prix de la Grotte). Melodist tracked the leaders before overtaking Miss Boniface before going to the front a furlong and a half from the finish. She faced a strong late challenge from Diminuendo and after a sustained struggle the two fillies crossed the line together with the judge declaring a dead heat.", "answer": "The 2/9 favourite for the race was Diminuendo, ridden by Steve Cauthen, who had won The Oaks by four lengths"}

{"question": "Title: Karen Horney Background: Karen Horney was born Karen Danielsen on 16 September 1885 in Blankenese, Germany, near Hamburg. Her father, Berndt Wackels Danielsen (1836-1910), was Norwegian but had German citizenship. He was a ship's captain in the merchant marine, and a Protestant traditionalist (his children nicknamed him \"the Bible-thrower\", as he did indeed throw Bibles). Her mother, Clotilde, nee van Ronzelen (1853-1911), known as \"Sonni\", was also Protestant, of Dutch origin. Section: Feminine psychology Passage: Horney was also a pioneer in the discipline of feminine psychiatry. As one of the first female psychiatrists, she was the first known woman to present a paper regarding feminine psychiatry. The fourteen papers she wrote between 1922 and 1937 were amalgamated into a single volume titled Feminine Psychology. As a woman, she felt that the mapping out of trends in female behaviour was a neglected issue. In her essay entitled \"The Problem of Feminine Masochism\", Horney felt she proved that cultures and societies worldwide encouraged women to be dependent on men for their love, prestige, wealth, care and protection. She pointed out that in the society, a will to please, satiate and overvalue men had emerged. Women were regarded as objects of charm and beauty--at variance with every human being's ultimate purpose of self-actualization.  Women, according to Horney, traditionally gain value only through their children and the wider family. She touched further on this subject in her essay \"The Distrust Between the Sexes\" in which she compared the husband-wife relationship to a parent-child relationship--one of misunderstanding and one which breeds detrimental neuroses. Most notably, her work \"The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal\" was fixed upon marriage, as were six other of Horney's papers. Her essay \"Maternal Conflicts\" attempted to shed new light on the problems women experience when raising adolescents.  Horney believed that both men and women have a drive to be ingenious and productive. Women are able to satisfy this need normally and internally--to do this they become pregnant and give birth. Men please this need only through external ways; Horney proposed that the striking accomplishments of men in work or some other field can be viewed as compensation for their inability to give birth to children.  Horney developed her ideas to the extent that she released one of the first \"self-help\" books in 1946, entitled Are You Considering Psychoanalysis?. The book asserted that those, both male and female, with relatively minor neurotic problems could, in effect, be their own psychiatrists. She continually stressed that self-awareness was a part of becoming a better, stronger, richer human being. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What is feminine psychology?

However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: φαρμακεία) derives from pharmakon (φάρμακον), meaning drug, medicine (or poison).[n 1]", "answer": ""}
{"question": "Title: Jared Leto Background: Jared Joseph Leto was born on December 26, 1971, in Bossier City, Louisiana, to Constance Leto (nee Metrejon). His mother has Cajun ancestry. \"Leto\" is the surname of his stepfather. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his older brother, Shannon Leto, lived with their mother and their maternal grandparents, Ruby (Russell) and William Lee Metrejon. Section: 1998-2002: Thirty Seconds to Mars, Requiem for a Dream, and other roles Passage: Leto formed the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars in 1998 in Los Angeles, California with his brother Shannon. When the group first started, Jared Leto did not allow his position of Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band. Their debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs. Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records.  In 1999, Leto played a gay high school teacher who attracts the attentions of Robert Downey, Jr. in Black and White, and got a supporting role in the drama Girl, Interrupted, an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. He then portrayed Angel Face in Fight Club (1999), a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher. He began dating actress Cameron Diaz in 1999 and the couple became engaged in 2000.  Leto played Paul Allen, a rival of Patrick Bateman, in the psychological thriller American Psycho (2000). Though the film polarized audiences and critics, Leto's performance was well received. The same year, he starred as heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream, an adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel of the same name, directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans. To prepare for his role, Leto lived on the streets of New York City and refrained from having sex for two months prior to shooting. He starved himself for months, losing 28 pounds to realistically play his heroin addict character. After the shooting of the film, Leto moved to Portugal and lived in a monastery for several months to gain weight. His performance received critical acclaim by film critics who notably praised the actor's emotional courage in portraying the character's physical and mental degradation. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone commented that Leto \"excels by going beyond Harry's gaunt look to capture his grieving heart. His scenes with Ellen Burstyn as Sara, Harry's widowed mother, achieve a rare poignancy as son and mother drown in delusions.\"  Leto next appeared in the independent film Highway. Set in 1994, Leto is caught with the wife of his employer, a Vegas thug, and flees to Seattle with his best friend Jake Gyllenhaal in the week preceding Kurt Cobain's suicide. Filming finished in early 2000, but the film was not released until March 2002 on home video formats, although originally scheduled for a theatrical release.  During this period Leto focused increasingly on his music career, working with producers Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue on his band's debut album 30 Seconds to Mars, which was released on August 27, 2002, in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. It reached number 107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers. Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; music critic Megan O'Toole felt that the band managed to \"carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.\" The album was a slow-burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide.

{"question": "Title: Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen Background: Archduke Charles of Austria, Duke of Teschen (German: Erzherzog Carl Ludwig Johann Joseph Laurentius von Osterreich, Herzog von Teschen; 5 September 1771 - 30 April 1847) was an Austrian field-marshal, the third son of Emperor Leopold II and his wife, Maria Luisa of Spain. He was also the younger brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. Despite being epileptic, Charles achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. Section: Assessment of his achievements Passage: The caution which the archduke preached so earnestly in his strategic works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favor of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at Wurzburg and Zurich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions.  According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition, his campaign of 1796 is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavorable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless, they cannot but be considered antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be gathered from the prescription that \"this principle is never to be departed from.\"  Again and again he repeated the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says, not the defeat of the enemy's army, decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main concern, a maxim which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defense against Clausewitz's reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to \"cover a retreat.\"  The baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of Koniggratz-Josefstadt in 1866 as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies, and in the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible Battle of Montebello in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.  He was the 831st Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What sort of achievements did the Duke have?

{"question": "Title: Lawrence Alma-Tadema Background: Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema,  (; born Lourens Alma Tadema Dutch pronunciation: ['l^ur@ns 'alma: 'ta:d@,ma:]; 8 January 1836 - 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Section: Later years Passage: Alma-Tadema's output decreased with time, partly on account of health, but also because of his obsession with decorating his new home, to which he moved in 1883. Nevertheless, he continued to exhibit throughout the 1880s and into the next decade, receiving a plentiful amount of accolades along the way, including the medal of Honour at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, election to an honorary member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1890, the Great Gold Medal at the International Exposition in Brussels of 1897. In 1899 he was Knighted in England, only the eighth artist from the Continent to receive the honour. Not only did he assist with the organisation of the British section at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, he also exhibited two works that earned him the Grand Prix Diploma. He also assisted with the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 where he was well represented and received.  During this time, Alma-Tadema was very active with theatre design and production, designing many costumes. He also spread his artistic boundaries and began to design furniture, often modelled after Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, illustrations, textiles, and frame making. His diverse interests highlight his talents. Each of these exploits were used in his paintings, as he often incorporated some of his designed furniture into the composition, and must have used many of his own designs for the clothing of his female subjects. Through his last period of creativity Alma-Tadema continued to produce paintings, which repeat the successful formula of women in marble terraces overlooking the sea such as in Silver Favourites (1903). Between 1906 and his death six years later, Alma-Tadema painted less but still produced ambitious paintings like The Finding of Moses (1904).

Little is known about the modifiable risk factors for glenohumeral joint instability.', 'Isometric shoulder strength at baseline would be a modifiable risk factor associated with subsequent first-time anterior instability events.', 'Cohort study.', 'Study participants were freshmen entering the United States Military Academy in June 2006. All participants completed bilateral isometric strength evaluations with a hand-held dynamometer at baseline upon entry into the study. Variables measured included internal and external rotation at 0° (IR0, ER0) and internal and external rotation at 45° of abduction (IR45, ER45). All subjects were followed for subsequent glenohumeral joint instability events until graduation in May 2010. Independent t tests were used to analyze the data.', 'Baseline strength data were available for 1316 shoulders with no prior history of instability, of which 26 went on to have an acute first-time anterior shoulder instability event while the individuals were at the academy.

The mean strength values in pounds of force for uninjured and injured shoulders, respectively, were as follows: IR0 (49.80 vs 49.29; P = .88), ER0 (35.58 vs 33.66; P = .27), IR45 (47.38 vs 46.93; P = .88), and ER45 (40.08 vs 38.98; P = .59).\\Question: Is rotator Cuff Weakness a Risk Factor for First-Time Anterior Glenohumeral Instability?", "answer": "No association was found between isometric shoulder strength measures at baseline and subsequent first-time anterior glenohumeral joint instability within the high-risk athletic population studied in this prospective cohort."}
{"question": "Title: Focus on the Family Background: Focus on the Family (FOTF or FotF) is an American Christian conservative organization founded in 1977 in Southern California by psychologist James Dobson, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is active in promoting an interdenominational effort toward its socially conservative views on public policy. Focus on the Family is one of a number of evangelical parachurch organizations that rose to prominence in the 1980s. As of the 2015 tax filing year, Focus on the Family declared itself to be a church. Section: Political positions and activities Passage: Focus on the Family's 501(c)(3) status prevents them from advocating any individual political candidate. Focus on the Family's magazine Citizen is exclusively devoted to cultural and public policy issues. FOTF also has an affiliated group, Family Policy Alliance, though the two groups are legally separate. As a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, Family Policy Alliance has fewer political lobbying restrictions. FOTF's revenue in 2012 was USD $90.5 million, and that of Family Policy Alliance (formerly CitizenLink) was USD $8 million.  Focus on the Family supports teaching of what it considers to be traditional \"family values\". It supports student-led and initiated prayer and supports the practice of corporal punishment. It strongly opposes LGBT rights, abortion, pornography, gambling, and pre-marital and extramarital sexual activity. Focus on the Family also promotes a religiously-centered conception of American identity and the support of Israel.  Focus on the Family maintains a strong stand against abortion, and provides grant funding and medical training to assist crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs; also known as pregnancy resource centers) in obtaining ultrasound machines. According to the organization, this funding, which has allowed CPCs to provide pregnant women with live sonogram images of the developing fetus, has led directly to the birth of over 1500 babies who would have otherwise been aborted. The organization has been staunchly opposed to public funding for elective abortions.  Focus on the Family broadcasts an eponymous national talk radio program. The program has a range of themes, such as fundamentalist Christian-oriented assistance for victims of rape or child abuse; parenting difficulties; child adoption; husband/wife roles; family history and traditions; struggles with gambling, pornography, alcohol, and drugs.  Focus on the Family has been a prominent supporter of the pseudoscience of intelligent design, publishing pro-intelligent design articles in its Citizen magazine and selling intelligent design videos on its website. Focus on the Family co-published the intelligent design videotape Unlocking the Mystery of Life with the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement.

In a letter to Mexico's ambassador in London, the BBC said it was sorry if it had offended some people, but said jokes based on national stereotyping were part of British national humour. The ambassador had demanded an apology, calling the remarks \"offensive, xenophobic and humiliating\". Hundreds of Mexicans contacted the BBC Spanish-language website BBC Mundo to protest about the remarks made by presenters Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May. 'Racist' Many more expressed outrage in e-mails to Mexican newspapers and websites, where the Top Gear jibes have received huge coverage. The matter was also raised in the Mexican senate, where lawmakers were considering a motion of censure. On Thursday an all-party group of British MPs also urged the BBC to apologise, calling the remarks \"ignorant, derogatory and racist\". In a statement, the BBC said the comments may have been \"rude\" and \"mischievous,\" but there was no \"vindictiveness\" behind them. \"Our own comedians make jokes about the British being terrible cooks and terrible romantics, and we in turn make jokes about the Italians being disorganised and over dramatic, the French being arrogant and the Germans being over-organised,\" the BBC said. It added that stereotype-based comedy was allowed within BBC guidelines in programmes where the audience knew they could expect it, as was the case with Top Gear. \"Whilst it may appear offensive to those who have not watched the programme or who are unfamiliar with its humour, the executive producer has made it clear to the ambassador that that was absolutely not the show's intention,\" the BBC added. 'Refried sick' The executive producer of Top Gear also apologised to ambassador Eduardo Medina Mora personally for remarks made about him. Jeremy Clarkson had said he was confident he would not receive any complaints about their comments because the Mexican ambassador would be asleep. The Top Gear team's comments about Mexicans were made when they were discussing a Mexican sports car. Richard Hammond said vehicles reflected national characteristics so \"Mexican cars are just going to be lazy\". Reviewing the Mastretta on Sunday's show, Hammond said: \"Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat.\" The presenters, known for their edgy jibes, then described Mexican food as \"refried sick\". It is not the first time the driving programme has caused controversy. Hundreds of viewers complained in 2008 after Clarkson made a joke about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. Last week, the programme was named most popular factual show at the British National TV Awards.", "answer": "The BBC has apologised for remarks made on the television programme, Top Gear, that caused outrage in Mexico."}

{"question": "Title: Stephen King Background: Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy. His books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television series, and comic books. King has published 54 novels, including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and six non-fiction books. He has written around 200 short stories, most of which have been collected in book collections. Section: Writing style Passage: King's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: \"If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\"  Shortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book Dreamcatcher with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called \"the world's finest word processor\".  When asked why he writes, King responds: \"The answer to that is fairly simple--there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do.\" He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: \"Why do you assume I have a choice?\" King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a \"what if\" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.  King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in Misery, adult Bill Denbrough in It, Ben Mears in Salem's Lot, and Jack Torrance in The Shining. He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the Dark Tower series from Wolves of the Calla onwards. See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for Fangoria.

{"question": "Title: Michelle Kwan Background: Michelle Wingshan Kwan (born July 7, 1980) is a retired American figure skater. She is a two-time Olympic medalist (1998 and 2002), a five-time World champion (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2003) and a nine-time U.S. champion (1996, 1998-2005). She is tied with Maribel Vinson for the all-time National Championship record. She competed at the senior level for over a decade and is the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history. Section: Artistic development and 1998 Olympics Passage: Michelle began to develop a more mature style in 1996. Her new, more artistically expressive programs were \"Romanza\" (short program) and \"Salome\" (free skate). She also improved her extension, speed and jump technique, and performed to more difficult choreography. She won both the U.S. Championships and the World Championships in 1996. In the later event, she edged out defending champion Chen Lu in a very close competition in which both competitors garnered two perfect 6.0s for Presentation in the free skate.  In the 1996-97 season, Kwan skated to \"Dream of Desdemona\" (short program) and \"Taj Mahal\" (free skate). During this season, Kwan struggled with her jumps because of a growth spurt and problems with new skating boots which she wore for an endorsement contract with the manufacturer. She fell twice and stumbled once in her free skate at 1997 U.S. Nationals, losing the title to Tara Lipinski. She lost the Champion Series Final to Lipinski a month later. At the World Championships, Kwan stepped out of her triple lutz combination and placed 4th in the Short Program portion of the competition behind Lipinski, France's Vanessa Gusmeroli, and Russia's Maria Butyrskaya. Kwan skated a six triple, mistake-free performance to win the freestyle portion of the competition, but placed second to Lipinski overall.  Kwan started out the 1997-1998 Olympic season by winning Skate America (where she defeated Tara Lipinski) and then Skate Canada. However, she suffered a stress fracture on her foot and was forced to withdraw from her third Champions Series Final. Kwan regained her U.S. title from Lipinski at the 1998 National Championships, despite her fractured toe. Many people consider her performances of her Rachmaninoff short program and free skate set to William Alwyn's \"Lyra Angelica\" at the 1998 U.S. Championships to be the high point of her career from both a technical and artistic standpoint. The performances earned her fifteen perfect 6.0s and left one judge in tears.  Kwan and Lipinski were co-favorites to win the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Kwan placed first in the Short Program portion of the competition, winning eight first place votes out of nine judges. In the free skate, Kwan skated a clean 7-triple performance but placed behind Lipinski, who also did 7 triples including a triple loop/triple loop combination and a triple toe-loop/half-loop/Triple Salchow. Kwan ended up winning the silver medal, with the gold medal going to Tara Lipinski and the bronze medal to Chen Lu.  Lipinski and Chen both retired from competitive skating shortly after the Olympics, while Kwan went on to win the 1998 World Championships in Minneapolis. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was included in her artistic development? Answer: Michelle began to develop a more mature style in 1996.

{"question": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.   The BBC broadcaster, who grew up in Northampton, said it was already a \"very thinned-out shopping area\". The town's Marks & Spencer store is earmarked for closure and the former BHS has been empty since 2016. The Conservative deputy leader of Northampton Borough Council has admitted the authority does not know how to improve the town's fortunes. Councillor Phil Larratt said: \"M&S will be a great loss, but that won't be the end of it because Debenhams is on a knife-edge. \"Everything is changing so much and so quickly that we don't know what the answer is.\" 'Ghost town' Rushden Lakes, a major out-out-town development 15 miles away, opened in July and free weekend parking in Northampton town centre came to an end this year. Michella Dos Santos said she would shut her Magic Bean Emporium cafe in St Giles Street in the summer after a \"huge decline\" and she knew other small businesses which were thinking of doing the same. She said: \"It was definitely the opening of Rushden Lakes and then the added problem of no free parking definitely added coal to the fire.\" Marks & Spencer announced proposed store closures last month, which included its Abington Street branch in Northampton, where there are 96 jobs. The company said it was a \"difficult decision\" but that it was committed to its new Rushden Lakes branch, which offers a \"better experience\" for customers. Mr Coles, a former member of pop group The Communards, BBC Radio Four presenter and Strictly Come Dancing celebrity contestant, hit out in a post on Twitter, in which he accused the retailer of \"abandoning\" Northampton. He said the town centre was \"decaying\", prompting responses from his Twitter followers who described it as \"almost a ghost town\" and \"increasingly hollowed out\". But the Finedon vicar, who is also the chancellor of the University of Northampton, said all was not lost. \"The university is opening a £330m new campus at the edge of the town centre which promises to bring much needed regeneration,\" he said. \"We have a great theatre, museums and civic buildings also.\" Danielle Stone, leader of the Labour group on the Northampton Borough Council, blamed the drop in footfall on \"de-pedestrianising Abington Street and allowing every application for betting shops, charity shops, pound shops, pawn brokers\". She called for new cycle routes, family bus passes and free parking. Councillor Jonathan Nunn, Tory leader of Northampton Borough Council insisted changes in parking charges had not had a \"significant impact\" on footfall. He said: \"There are no plans to change the current approach on car parking charges, however we will continue to monitor the situation. \"We're working with the Northampton Town Centre Business Improvement District [BID] to support regular events and initiatives which help increase footfall and attract families into the town centre, such as the recent Street Circus and the Market Square beach in August.\"", "answer": "A \"decaying\" town centre risks losing \"even more energy and prosperity\", the Reverend Richard Coles has warned."}

{"question": "Title: Nicholas Culpeper Background: Nicholas Culpeper (probably born at Ockley, Surrey, 18 October 1616 - died at Spitalfields, London, 10 January 1654) was an English botanist, herbalist, physician, and astrologer. His published books includes The English Physitian (1652), i. e. the Complete Herbal (1653 ff), which contains a rich store of pharmaceutical and herbal knowledge, and Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick (1655), which is one of the most detailed documents known on the practice of medical astrology in Early Modern Europe. Culpeper spent the greater part of his life in the English outdoors cataloguing hundreds of medicinal herbs. He criticized what he considered the unnatural methods of his contemporaries, writing: \"This not being pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, Dr. Reason and Dr. Experience, and took a voyage to visit my mother Nature, by whose advice, together with the help of Dr. Diligence, I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by Mr. Honesty, a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it.\" Section: Biography Passage: Culpeper was the son of Nicholas Culpeper (Senior), a clergyman. Culpeper studied at Cambridge, but it is not known at which college - though his father studied at Queens'. He afterwards became apprenticed to an apothecary. After seven years his master absconded with the money paid for the indenture, and soon after this, Culpeper's mother died of breast cancer. Culpeper married the daughter of a wealthy merchant, which allowed him to set up a pharmacy in the halfway house in Spitalfields, London, outside the authority of the City of London at a time when medical facilities in London were at breaking point. Arguing that \"no man deserved to starve to pay an insulting, insolent physician\", and obtaining his herbal supplies from the nearby countryside, Culpeper was able to provide his services for free. This, and a willingness to examine patients in person rather than simply examining their urine (in his opinion, \"as much piss as the Thames might hold\" did not help in diagnosis), Culpeper was extremely active, sometimes seeing as many as forty people in one morning. Using a combination of experience and astrology, Culpeper devoted himself to using herbs to treat the illnesses of his patients.  During the early months of the English Civil War he was accused of witchcraft and the Society of Apothecaries tried to rein in his practice. Alienated and radicalised he joined a trainband in August 1643 and fought at the First Battle of Newbury, where he carried out battlefield surgery. Culpeper was taken back to London after sustaining a serious chest injury from which he never recovered. There, in co-operation with the Republican astrologer William Lilly, he wrote the work A Prophesy of the White King, which predicted the king's death.  He died of tuberculosis in London on 10 January 1654 at the age of 37 and was buried in New Churchyard, Bethlem. Only one of his seven children, Mary, survived to adulthood.

{"question": "Title: Ibn Jubayr Background: Ibn Jubayr (1 September 1145 -29 November 1217; Arabic: bn jbyr), also written Ibn Jubair, Ibn Jobair, and Ibn Djubayr, was an Arab geographer, traveller and poet from al-Andalus. His travel chronicle describes the pilgrimage he made to Mecca from 1183 to 1185, in the years preceding the Third Crusade. Section: Ibn Jubayr in Sicily Passage: In Sicily, at the very late stages of his travels (Dec 1184-Jan 1185), Ibn Jubayr recounts other experiences. He comments on the activity of the volcanoes:  At the close of night a red flame appeared, throwing up tongues into the air. It was the celebrated volcano (Stromboli). We were told that a fiery blast of great violence bursts out from air-holes in the two mountains and makes the fire. Often a great stone is cast up and thrown into the air by the force of the blast and prevented thereby from falling and settling at the bottom. This is one of the most remarkable of stories, and it is true.  As for the great mountain in the island, known as the Jabal al-Nar [Mountain of Fire], it also presents a singular feature in that some years a fire pours from it in the manner of the `bursting of the dam'. It passes nothing it does not burn until, coming to the sea, it rides out on its surface and then subsides beneath it. Let us praise the Author of all things for His marvelous creations. There is no God but He.  Also striking Ibn Jubayr is the city of Palermo. He describes it as follows:  It is the metropolis of these islands, combining the benefits of wealth and splendour, and having all that you could wish of beauty, real or apparent, and all the needs of subsistence, mature and fresh. It is an ancient and elegant city, magnificent and gracious, and seductive to look upon. Proudly set between its open spaces and plains filled with gardens, with broad roads and avenues, it dazzles the eyes with its perfection. It is a wonderful place, built in the Cordova style, entirely from cut stone known as kadhan [a soft limestone]. A river splits the town, and four springs gush in its suburbs... The King roams through the gardens and courts for amusement and pleasure... The Christian women of this city follow the fashion of Muslim women, are fluent of speech, wrap their cloaks about them, and are veiled.

I did it in circular motions - it takes about 12 hours to set it. It smells like self tanning lotion it stinks 2 days then the smell goes away. However when I applied it, after it set it, I had so many blotchy spots and my feet looked horrible. The tanning lotion is so runny it actually put a runny stain on the bottom of my foot. I scrubbed it to try to get it off and it wont come off at all, it just has to wear off. At least I applied it in the winter. If I applied this in the summer I would not go out of my house for a week until it all came off. I am going to try to reapply with a mit and see what happens.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.   Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : My roommate would prefer the air to be at 74 degrees. I would prefer for it to be at 68 (both for comfort reasons and for cost reasons).  My roommate and I talked and agreed to keep the air at 70-71 so that our electricity bill wouldn’t cost as much. It’s mostly remained at 71 because I try to be nice and I know she gets cold.  Well, I at least try. Multiple times now, I’ve caught the air back up to 74 or 73, coming home after weekends away to a super hot apartment. Sometimes even if I’ve been in my room too long she will secretly raise the temperature despite our agreement.  I have tolerated this for about two months now (we made the agreement in November, she began fringing on it in December). For awhile, I would just lower it back down to 71 and move on.  But this week has had nice weather, to the point that without our air on, our apartments temperature has remained at 70 which is pretty damn nice, except she just raised the air to 72 right before bed.  I would feel bad if it wasn’t for the fact she does nothing to help herself. She wears short sleeves in the apartment, no socks. She won’t use blankets or keep her door open at night to allow air to circulate.  I just feel that if she is going to ignore our agreement then I will as well. We had talked about this once and it bothers me that I have to keep talking to her about the air.  So, will I be the asshole if I turn the air off at night (only on warmer nights) without my roommates knowledge?  TLDR: Roommate and I agreed to keep temperature at 71, she keeps turning it up to 74.

{"question": "Title: Mazzy Star Background: Mazzy Star is an American alternative rock band formed in Santa Monica, California, in 1989 from remnants of the group Opal. Founding member David Roback's friend Hope Sandoval became the group's vocalist when Kendra Smith left Opal. Mazzy Star is best known for the song \"Fade into You\" which brought the band some success in the mid-1990s and was the group's biggest mainstream hit, earning extensive exposure on MTV, VH1, and radio airplay. Roback and Sandoval are the creative center of the band, with Sandoval as lyricist and Roback as composer of the majority of the band's material. Section: Reformation and Seasons of Your Day (2010-2014) Passage: The first substantive confirmation that the duo would reconvene to complete work on their fourth studio album came from Sandoval herself in a July 2009 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, where she was quoted as saying, \"It's true we're still together. We're almost finished [with the record]. But I have no idea what that means.\" Later, in a September 2009 interview with Vancouver-based music website Straight.com, interviewer John Lucas wrote of the 8-year gap between Bavarian Fruit Bread and Through the Devil Softly, \"That seems like a long time until you consider that Mazzy Star, Sandoval's partnership with guitarist David Roback, hasn't put an album out since 1996. Sandoval promises that will change; she and Roback have their very own Chinese Democracy in the works, but it won't see the light of day until The Warm Inventions have wrapped up their tour.\"  On October 12, 2011, Hope Sandoval's official website confirmed the duo would release their first new material in fifteen years later that same month. The double a-sided single \"Common Burn\"/\"Lay Myself Down\" was released digitally on October 31, 2011. A limited edition blue-coloured 7\" vinyl was also announced for release on November 8, though a manufacturing delay resulted in its release being pushed back to January 24, 2012. Their fourth studio album was expected to be released in the latter half of 2012, following completion of a tour earlier in the year.  The band completed an 18-date Californian and European tour in 2012, their first since 2000. Performing at several major European festivals, the band consisted of original members Suki Ewers and Keith Mitchell, and were also joined by Sandoval's Warm Inventions band-mate Colm O Ciosoig and Keith Mitchell's son Paul, whose band the Brook Lee Catastrophe also served as the opening act of select shows. Pedal steel guitar was performed by Josh Yenne. After the final date of the tour in August 2012, David Roback stated that production on the album had completed and that it would see release \"soon\". In late 2012, several unreleased song titles composed by Hope Sandoval and David Roback were registered with the band's long-time publisher BMI, including \"Flying Low\" and \"Spoon\", both of which were performed multiple times on the tour. The band also launched an official merchandise store.  On July 13, 2013, the band announced details of their fourth studio album, Seasons of Your Day, which was released on September 23, 2013 in the UK, followed a day later on September 24 in the US. The album reached a career-high No. 24 on the UK albums chart. The band began a North American tour on November 3, 2013 in support of the album. On April 19, the band released two new songs as part of Record Store Day 2014. \"I'm Less Here\" and \"Things\" were released on 7\" vinyl, with the run limited to 3,000 copies worldwide. On December 22, 2014, a 40-second clip of a previously unreleased song was posted on to the band's official Facebook account.

{"question": "Title: Robert Crumb Background: Robert Dennis Crumb (; born August 30, 1943) is an American cartoonist and musician who often signs his work R. Crumb. His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture. Crumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the underground comix movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, Zap Comix, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the East Village Other and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. Section: Early work (1962-1966) Passage: Crumb's father gave him $40 when he left home after high school. His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career. In Cleveland he met a group of young bohemians such as Buzzy Linhart, Liz Johnston, and Harvey Pekar. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work. In 1965, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, Help!. Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but Help! ceased publication shortly after. Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for Topps before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings.  Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964. Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food. The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b. 1965).  In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men's magazine Cavalier. Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969.  Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD, a psychedelic drug that was then still legal. He had both good and bad trips. One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966. Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what did he do in 1962?

{"question": "Title: Paramore Background: Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee, formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro. Williams and Farro are founding members of the group, while York, a high school friend of the original lineup, joined in 2007. Williams is the only member to appear on all five of Paramore's studio albums and has been the only constant member of the band.

On October 8, Paramore played \"Misery Business\" live on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, a booking made possible due to the friendship struck between the band and Max Weinberg during the 2007 Warped Tour. In August, Paramore participated in New Found Glory's music video for their cover of Sixpence None the Richer's song \"Kiss Me\".  From September 29 to November 1, 2009, the band held a tour in North America to support Brand New Eyes.

Mark Lawlor, the island's bird recorder, was with his daughter at L'Eree Shingle Bank when he saw the Bonaparte's gull. The bird is thought to have crossed the Atlantic after getting caught in a weather front. An ornithologist at the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), said it was \"an incredible find for the lucky finder\". Mr Lawlor said he saw the gull at about midday on Monday. \"I stopped for a quick scan with my binoculars to see if anything unusual had arrived on the island in the cold weather,\" he said. Mr Lawlor, whose job as a bird recorder for the Société Guernesiaise includes collating and verifying bird sightings, said he saw the small gull on the shoreline and \"had a feeling\" it looked slightly different to a common black-headed gull. He added: \"I noticed pale pink legs and it flapped its wing to reveal a pale underwing, which are all features of Bonaparte's gull. \"As recorder I know which species have and haven't been seen before on the island so I knew this was something new. \"Of course finding a new species for the island was pretty exciting for me.\" Paul Stancliffe, from BTO, said the Bonaparte's gull was an \"annual rare visitor\" to the UK with a handful of sightings recorded each year. \"Right now the Guernsey bird is the only Bonaparte's gull in the UK and is indeed the first for the island,\" he said. \"Bonaparte's gulls breed in northern North America and winter in southern North America, as far south as Mexico - this bird will have got caught up in a weather front that tracked across the Atlantic as it was making its journey south.\" Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

{"question": "Title: Len Ford Background: Leonard Guy Ford Jr. (February 18, 1926 - March 14, 1972) was an American football player from 1944 to 1958. He played college football for the University of Michigan and professional football for the Los Angeles Dons, Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976 and the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996. Ford was an all-city athlete at his high school in Washington, D.C., and attended Morgan State University after graduating in 1944. Section: Los Angeles Dons (AAFC) Passage: Despite his accomplishments in college, Ford was passed over in all 32 rounds of the 1948 NFL Draft during a time when most professional teams did not employ African-Americans. (The following year, George Taliaferro became the first African-American to be selected in an NFL draft.) He was selected, however, by the Los Angeles Dons of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in the third round of its 1948 draft. He signed with the Dons in April 1948.  Playing as a right end opposite Joe Aguirre, Ford had 31 catches for 598 yards and seven touchdowns in 1948. As was the case at Michigan, Ford also worked on defense and was one of the AAFC's most successful pass-rushers. The Dons, meanwhile, finished the regular season with a 7-7 record, good for third place in the AAFC West. Ford played basketball in the off-season for the New York Renaissance, an all-black professional team in the National Basketball League. He did not play basketball at Michigan, the Big Ten Conference having maintained racial segregation of basketball until 1950.  Ford had 36 catches for 577 yards and one touchdown in 1949, while the Dons fell to 4-8. The AAFC struggled financially during Ford's time with the Dons. Its teams competed with NFL franchises for fans' attention and player talent - the Dons shared a city with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams. By late 1949, team owners came to an agreement under which the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts joined the NFL and the rest of the league's teams, including the Dons, folded. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did he play in Los Angeles? Answer: He signed with the Dons in April 1948. Question: Was he a star player? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: How long did he play in Los Angeles? Answer: late 1949, Question: Was he a starter player? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Did the team do well during his time there?

{"question": "Title: Mario Lanza Background: Mario Lanza (born Alfredo Arnold Cocozza; January 31, 1921 - October 7, 1959) was an American tenor of Italian ancestry, and an actor and Hollywood film star of the late 1940s and the 1950s. Lanza began studying to be a professional singer at the age of 16. After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year film contract with Louis B. Mayer, the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Section: Serenade Passage: Lanza returned to an active film career in 1955 in Serenade, released by Warner Bros. However the film was not as successful as his previous films, despite its strong musical content, including arias from Der Rosenkavalier, Fedora, L'arlesiana, and Otello, as well as the Act I duet from Otello with soprano Licia Albanese. Ms. Albanese said of Lanza in 1980:  I had heard all sorts of stories about Mario [Lanza]. That his voice was too small for the stage, that he couldn't learn a score, that he couldn't sustain a full opera; in fact, that he couldn't even sing a full aria, that his recordings were made by splicing together various portions of an aria. None of it is true! He had the most beautiful lirico spinto voice. It was a gorgeous, beautiful, powerful voice. I should know because I sang with so many tenors. He had everything that one needs. The voice, the temperament, perfect diction. ... Vocally he was very secure. All he needed was coaching. Everything was so easy for him. He was fantastic!  He then moved to Rome, Italy in May 1957, where he worked on the film Seven Hills of Rome, and returned to live performing in November of that year, singing for Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium. From January to April 1958, Lanza gave a concert tour of the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany. He gave a total of 22 concerts on this tour, receiving mostly positive reviews for his singing. Despite a number of cancellations, which resulted from his failing health during this period, Lanza continued to receive offers for operatic appearances, concerts, and films.  In September 1958, he made a number of operatic recordings at the Rome Opera House for the soundtrack of what would turn out to be his final film, For the First Time. It was then that he came to the attention of that opera house's artistic director, Riccardo Vitale, who promptly offered the tenor carte blanche in his choice of operatic roles. Lanza also received offers to sing in any opera of his choosing from the San Carlo in Naples. At the same time, however, his health continued to decline, with the tenor suffering from a variety of ailments, including phlebitis and acute high blood pressure. His old habits of overeating and crash dieting, coupled with binge drinking, compounded his problems. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what is the relevance of Serenade?

The baskets went missing at the store in Cambridge after the company began phasing out 5p plastic bags. The store only has 30 to 40 left for its customers. An Asda spokesman said the firm asked \"that the small number of customers who are taking our baskets home with them use their bags for life instead\". A new load of 100 plastic green baskets to replace those that have gone missing is set to arrive at the store at the Beehive Centre next week. A 5p charge on the thin, single-use plastic bags was introduced in 2015 but Asda pledged in February to end the sale of those bags by the end of this year. Stocks of 5p bags at Asda stores are no longer being replenished when they run out, but larger and sturdier \"bags for life\", costing 9p, are still available. Currently, Cambridge is understood to be the only Asda store with a basket shortage. Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons have all either phased out the single-use plastic bags or are in the process of doing so. Other retailers have electronic tags on their baskets in some stores as a preventative measure to avoid customers taking them home. Tesco said they were unaware of similar basket problems in any of their stores but one person responded to the BBC on Twitter to claim that there was a \"massive problem\" at his local store: Morrisons also said it was unaware of issues but another person on Twitter questioned why they used tags in the Basingstoke shop: Sainsbury's said it was not aware of any issues with baskets being taken from its stores.

{"question": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not.   My brother and I used to live together until eight months ago or so. We had lived together and talked daily in passing for at least six years. He moved out because he needed to (30, living in the basement, smelled, and never had a job or tried to find one) and I was getting married. We talked and I offered to be the one to leave, but he chose to go instead so I didn’t kick him out.   After that, he didn’t call. He didn’t write. He didn’t initiate contact once. He would take many days to reply to a text and be upset if I suggested social norms suggested texting back sooner than 6 days. I have only seen him for major holidays because of my parents and because months later he still hadn’t changed his address so he would pick up mail. Even when he was at a holiday he would be alone on his computer.   After months of almost no contact after living with him and talking to him daily, I indicated I was very hurt that he did not seem to want me in his life and that he never expressed any indication that he loved me or even cared about me. I even asked him when the last time he said I love you to anyone was. His reply was less than a week ago. He has not once ever said this to me. Not once.    At that point, all I felt was mourning the loss of a brother. It’s like he vanished from my life and like the only reason he talked to me before was because we lived together, not because he wanted to. It felt like the whole time I was living a lie. So I told him I wanted a relationship with him, but he had to be the one to initiate contact. It hurts me every time I contact him and he doesn’t... do... anything and he just sounds like he wants to stop talking and be left alone. He told me I was being overly sensitive and emotional and that he did want a relationship.   The kicker is he is autistic. I don’t think he feels the same needs in a relationship as I do. I don’t think he wants a monthly phone call and doesn’t understand why I do. He doesn’t understand why I’m sad, though I have explained myself. I think he is being hurtful and showing that he does not care about a relationship with me. I specifically stated what I needed from a relationship with him if he wanted to have one (which wasn’t much, just a 5 minute phone call once a month and maybe actually doing something on holidays with his family instead of his computer). He couldn’t be bothered to humor me for five minutes once a month. I’ve done so many things to humor him and his quirks. Even if I don’t understand why he wants things, I’ll go along with it. And he won’t do the same.    So I said I’m not going to contact him again because it hurts too much. Now my parents are calling me wrong for not engaging with him and that I should tolerates these hurtful behaviors from him “because he is different.”    So am I the asshole for not contacting a brother who doesn’t seem to care anyways?", "answer": "explicitly stating I am not going to contact my autistic brother"}
{"question": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.   By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website The crabs reproduce by releasing many larvae into the water so that a handful reach other vents and colonise them. But it is thought that they survive for only a short time in open waters; so a strong west-to-east current around Antarctica may have aided their spread. The animal was discovered in 2011. The \"Hoff\" is a type of yeti crab, which is recognised for its hairs, or setae, along its claws and limbs. It lives in one of the most extreme environments on the planet; more than 2,000m under the sea where volcanic vents superheat the water to 380C and there is no light and very little oxygen. The crab feeds by \"farming\" bacteria on its hairy chest, then using special comb-like mouthparts to strain off the microbes so that it can eat them. The crustacean's humorous nickname honours the hairy-chested US actor and singer David Hasselhoff. In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr Christopher Roterman and colleagues propose that the \"Hoff crab\" probably originated around the vents that populate mid-ocean ridges in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It then expanded into the Atlantic through the Drake Passage that separates South America and Antarctica, spreading along volcanic vent regions that are now extinct. The crab appears to have exploited the ocean current known as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which flows in a clockwise direction, west to east around Antarctica, through Drake Passage. The crabs can occur at astonishing densities around vents in the southern part of their range. But at the volcanic vents of the south-west Indian ridge, for example, the crabs only occur at low densities and are swamped by other vent animals. Dr Roterman, a zoologist at the University of Oxford, said the exact reasons for this were unclear, but it could have something to do with the crab's reproductive strategy. \"We suspect their [larvae] dispersal capability may be limited,\" he told BBC News. \"The fact they have spread so quickly in the Southern Ocean is because the ACC provides a high-speed highway for their larvae. \"But when they head further north, we think they may have a disadvantage against other hydrothermal vent animals.\" This part of the research is only at a preliminary stage, said Dr Roterman, but examinations of the crab's larvae reveal they resemble miniature versions of the adult animal. However, these lack a functional mouth and have a small yolk sac. This suggests they may only be able to survive for short times in the water. Analysis of the DNA of yeti crabs - including the Hoff variety - suggests these crustaceans began to expand and diversify about 40 million years ago. Some scientists had wondered whether the animals living around volcanic vents were relic species, largely unaffected by environmental changes on land and shallower parts of the ocean. But most of the species living around volcanic vents today appear to have radiated within the last 55 million years. The reasons for this are unclear, but a period of intense global warming spanning several million years that dramatically reduced deep-sea oxygen levels globally could be to blame. This event is known as the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum and is marked by a rise in global temperatures of 6C. The causes remain unclear but the initial changes could have been amplified by a massive release into the atmosphere of methane stored in icy deposits on the ocean floor. The latest paper appears to confirm a picture in which the inhabitants of deep-sea vents may be periodically wiped out and the vents only repopulated by a wave of new species once conditions become favourable again. During episodes of extreme climate warming, circulation between the well oxygenated surface waters and those deeper down is thought to decline, leading to the gradual depletion of oxygen in the deep sea. \"Yeti crabs and other such creatures may in fact be especially prone to extinction when there is less oxygen available in the deep ocean,\" said Dr Roterman. \"This is because if deep-sea ocean oxygen levels fall, the amount of oxygen available to these animals, that already live in an oxygen-poor environment at the limits of their physiological tolerance, may drop below the minimum level at which they can survive. \"They would face the stark choice of 'suffocate or starve'.\" Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter", "answer": "A hairy crab named after David Hasselhoff hitched a ride on an ocean \"super-highway\" to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic millions of years ago."}

{"question": "In how many ways can 10 distinct balls be placed into 4 identical boxes if each box must have at least 1 balls? Relevant Theorem: Stirling Numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), are used in combinatorics to count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In other words, they represent the number of ways to distribute n distinct items into k distinct groups, where each group has at least one item.  The Stirling Numbers of the second kind can be defined recursively using the following formula:  S(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)  with the base cases:  S(n, 0) = 0 if n > 0, S(0, 0) = 1, S(n, k) = 0 if k > n.  The first term, k * S(n-1, k), represents the case where the nth element is added to one of the existing k subsets. The second term, S(n-1, k-1), represents the case where the nth element forms a new subset by itself.  Here are some examples of Stirling Numbers of the second kind:  S(3, 2) = 3: There are three ways to partition a set of 3 elements into 2 non-empty subsets: {1, 2}, {3}; {1, 3}, {2}; {1}, {2, 3}. S(4, 2) = 7: There are seven ways to partition a set of 4 elements into 2 non-empty subsets: {1, 2, 3}, {4}; {1, 2, 4}, {3}; {1, 3, 4}, {2}; {2, 3, 4}, {1}; {1, 2}, {3, 4}; {1, 3}, {2, 4}; {1, 4}, {2, 3}.

{"question": "A muon has a lifetime of 2 x 10^{-6} s in its rest frame. It is created 100 km above the earth and moves towards it at a speed of 2.97 x 10^8 m/s. At what altitude in km does it decay? Return a numeric number. Relevant Theorem: Relativity is a scientific theory that fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It was first introduced by the renowned physicist Albert Einstein in the early 20th century and consists of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity.  1. Special Theory of Relativity (1905): This theory deals with objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those moving close to the speed of light. It is based on two main principles:     a. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.    b. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source.  The Special Theory of Relativity led to several counterintuitive conclusions, such as time dilation (moving clocks run slower), length contraction (moving objects appear shorter), and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc^2), which states that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.  2. General Theory of Relativity (1915): This theory is an extension of the Special Theory of Relativity and deals with gravity. It describes gravity not as a force between masses, as proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. In other words, massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of spacetime, causing other objects to move along curved paths.  The General Theory of Relativity has been confirmed through various experiments and observations, such as the bending of light around massive objects (gravitational lensing), the shift in the orbit of Mercury, and the detection of gravitational waves.  In summary, Relativity is a groundbreaking theory that has reshaped our understanding of the universe, providing a more accurate and comprehensive description of the fundamental concepts of space, time, and gravity.", "answer": "4.2"}

{"question": "Title: Manorialism Background: Manorialism was an essential element of feudal society. It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. Section: History Passage: The word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside, reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manors or seigneuries; each manor being subject to a lord (French seigneur), usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord (see Feudalism). The lord held a manorial court, governed by public law and local custom. Not all territorial seigneurs were secular; bishops and abbots also held lands that entailed similar obligations.  By extension, the word manor is sometimes used in England to mean any home area or territory in which authority is held, often in a police or criminal context.  In the generic plan of a medieval manor from Shepherd's Historical Atlas, the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent. In this plan, the manor house is set slightly apart from the village, but equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor, formerly walled, while the manor lands stretched away outside, as still may be seen at Petworth House. As concerns for privacy increased in the 18th century, manor houses were often located a farther distance from the village. For example, when a grand new house was required by the new owner of Harlaxton Manor, Lincolnshire, in the 1830s, the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one, isolated in its park, with the village out of view.  In an agrarian society, the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors. There were two legal systems of pre-manorial landholding. One, the most common, was the system of holding land \"allodially\" in full outright ownership. The other was a use of precaria or benefices, in which land was held conditionally (the root of the English word \"precarious\").  To these two systems, the Carolingian monarchs added a third, the aprisio, which linked manorialism with feudalism. The aprisio made its first appearance in Charlemagne's province of Septimania in the south of France, when Charlemagne had to settle the Visigothic refugees, who had fled with his retreating forces, after the failure of his Zaragoza expedition of 778. He solved this problem by allotting \"desert\" tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal fisc under direct control of the emperor. These holdings aprisio entailed specific conditions. The earliest specific aprisio grant that has been identified was at Fontjoncouse, near Narbonne (see Lewis, links). In former Roman settlements, a system of villas, dating from Late Antiquity, was inherited by the medieval world. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did Manorialism first appear?

There was never any inappropriate talking or actions between us while they were together a while after their separation we started sleeping together and she was asking about dating I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable dating until she finished her divorce and worked on improving herself and figuring out why she cheated so much. 2 months later she told me she had a boyfriend now so we had to stop the sex part of our friendship. We went back to how it was before.  She moved in with her boyfriend, and started acting really weird so I asked what was going on and she told me she hasn’t told him about me so she only talked to me while he was gone (she doesn’t have a job so he pays for everything for her, and is talking about paying to help her go to school) so I started pushing her to tell him about me and introduce us. Her boyfriend found out about me and we talked a little, I found out they started their relationship before she ended things with me.   I confronted her about it and she confirmed they were in a relationship at that point and she lied to me about being single and cheated on him. I told her he deserved to know and she should tell him. She said “it should be my choice to tell him, and I don’t want my past to ruin this, I didn’t know what this relationship was going to turn into and I ended the cheating”. I decided that the guy deserved to know anyway so I decided if she wouldn’t tell him within 2 weeks I would. I tried to talk to her a couple times ending with crying and begging me not to bring it up again, then I told her to meet me on the last day so we could figure out this situation in a face to face conversation so it could be resolved she agreed but never showed up so I called her boyfriend and told him.   She lied saying the weekend in particular that I told him about she was with family so he called her grandma who she was living with at the time and she said she was with family that weekend so apparently she started this lie before it ever happened, she started telling her boyfriend more lies and he started talking a lot of shit and threatening me so I went to bed, in the morning it hit me she can’t fake bank charges I sent him a message saying ask for her statement for that weekend and there will be 3 charges at specific locations which are not in the city she claimed to be in, she kept denying it, the next morning he messaged me to say that she admitted it finally and that she isn’t allowed to talk to me so if she contacts me to let him know which I told him to go fuck himself and if I choose to keep talking to my friend in the future it’s not his decision then he threatened to beat me up a bunch more.", "answer": "EVERYBODY"}

Africa had until now largely been spared the rapid spread of COVID-19, which has infected at least 135,000 people and killed around 5,000 worldwide. Most of Africa’s reported cases were foreigners or people who had traveled abroad. Rapid testing and quarantines have been put in place to limit transmission. But concerns are growing about the continent’s ability to handle the disease. Cases have been reported in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. Mauritania’s health ministry said late on Friday that its first coronavirus patient is a European man - nationality not specified - who had returned to Nouakchott on March 9 and had since been in quarantine. The numbers of cases in most of the countries are still in single figures. Senegal confirmed 11 new cases on Friday, raising the total in that West African nation to 21. Its health ministry said 16 had been infected by the same man who had returned from Italy. Among those confirming first cases on Friday, Kenya is the richest economy in East Africa and a hub for global companies and the United Nations, while Ethiopia is Africa’s second-most populous nation, with 109 million people. Addis Ababa and Nairobi are regional transit hubs. In Nairobi, the Kenyan authorities banned all major public events and said they would restrict foreign travel. The mayor of Addis Ababa urged citizens to avoid close personal contact but Ethiopia’s health minister said there were no plans to cancel flights. Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the country’s first case, a 27-year-old Kenyan, was diagnosed on Thursday after traveling home via London on March 5. He said the government had traced most of the people she had been in contact with, including fellow passengers on her flight, and a government response team would monitor their temperatures for the next two weeks. The Ethiopian case was a 48-year old Japanese national who arrived in Ethiopia on March 4, the health ministry said. Guinea’s first case was an employee of the European Union delegation who had self-isolated after she felt ill upon returning from Europe, the EU delegation said. Sudan’s first confirmed coronavirus case was a man who died on Thursday in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the Health Ministry said. He had visited the United Arab Emirates in the first week of March. Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the government had suspended all public gatherings, sporting events, open-air religious meetings and events “of a huge public nature”. Schools will remain open but inter-school events were suspended. Public transport operators must install hand sanitizers in their vehicles and clean them regularly, Kagwe said, while foreign travel would be restricted. Soon after the announcement, shoppers in one Nairobi supermarket were buying up cart loads of staples such as maize flour and water, as well as hand sanitizers and soap. Kenya Airways suspended flights to China last month and on Thursday added Rome and Geneva to the list of suspended destinations. Kenya, which relies heavily on Asian imports, has seen disruptions to its supply chain and a decline in tourism, an important source of hard currency and jobs. “We are going to be hit badly,” Tourism Minister Najib Balala told journalists. The Nairobi Securities Exchange halted trading in the afternoon after the main NSE 20 share index   dropped by more than 5% following the news. Mauritius, an island nation off the coast of East Africa whose economy depends on tourism and financial services, has yet to report any COVID-19 cases but said it was offering liquidity to banks to support struggling firms hit by the impact of the virus and cutting banks’ cash reserve requirements.", "answer": "Kenya, Ethiopia join expanding list of African states with coronavirus."}
{"question": "Title: Friedrich Hölderlin Background: Johann Christian Friedrich Holderlin (German: ['jo:han 'kRIsti.a:n 'fRi: Section: Career Passage: After obtaining his magister degree in 1793, his mother expected him to enter the ministry. However, Holderlin found no satisfaction in the prevailing Protestant theology, and worked instead as a private tutor. In 1794, he met Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang Goethe and began writing his epistolary novel Hyperion. In 1795 he enrolled for a while at the University of Jena where he attended Johann Gottlieb Fichte's classes and met Novalis.  There is a seminal manuscript, dated 1797, now known as the Das alteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus (\"The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism\"). Although the document is in Hegel's handwriting, it is thought to have been written by either Hegel, Schelling, Holderlin, or an unknown fourth person.  As a tutor in Frankfurt am Main from 1796 to 1798 he fell in love with Susette Gontard, the wife of his employer, the banker Jakob Gontard. The feeling was mutual, and this relationship became the most important in Holderlin's life. After a while, their affair was discovered, and Holderlin was harshly dismissed. He then lived in Homburg from 1798 to 1800, meeting Susette in secret once a month and attempting to establish himself as a poet, but his life was plagued by financed worries and had to accept a small allowance from his mother. His mandated separation from Susette Gontard also worsened Holderlin's doubts about himself and his value as a poet; he wished to transform German culture but did not have the influence he needed. From 1797 to 1800, he produced three versions--all unfinished--of a tragedy in the Greek manner, The Death of Empedocles, and composed odes in the vein of the Ancient Greeks Alcaeus and Asclepiades of Samos. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did his career begin? Answer: 1793, Question: What was his first project?

{"question": "Commentator: In academic scholarship, sources are always cited, and methodology and theoretical assumptions are set out, so as to allow critical study, replication, and expansion of scholarship. In open-source software, the code in which the program is written can be viewed and modified by individual users for their purposes without getting permission from the producer or paying a fee. In contrast, the code of proprietary software is kept secret, and modifications can be made only by the producer, for a fee. This shows that open-source software better matches the values embodied in academic scholarship, and since scholarship is central to the mission of universities, universities should use only open-source software. The commentator's reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? A: Universities should use the type of software technology that is least expensive, as long as that type of software technology is adequate for the purposes of academic scholarship. B: A university should not pursue any activity that would block the achievement of the goals of academic scholarship at that university. C: The form of software technology that best matches the values embodied in the activities that are central to the mission of universities is the form of software technology that is most efficient for universities to use.

{"question": "Title: Georgia O'Keeffe Background: O'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse located at 2405 Hwy T in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. Section: Legacy Passage: O'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \"The most remarkable thing about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography.  A substantial part of her estate's assets were transferred to the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiu house, library, and property. The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiu was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and is now owned by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.  In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp honoring O'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O'Keeffe's Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie's II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series.  A fossilized species of archosaur was named Effigia okeeffeae (\"O'Keeffe's Ghost\") in January 2006, \"in honor of Georgia O'Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the Coelophysis Quarry when it was discovered\".  O'Keeffe holds the record ($44.4 million in 2014) for the highest price paid for a painting by a woman. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What is she most remembered for Answer: O'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art.

{"question": "Solve the following linear programming problems: maximize 3x + y subject to (1) -x + y <= 1, (2) 2x + y <= 4, (3) x>= 0 and y >= 0. What's [x, y] for the optimal solution? Relevant Theorem: Integer Programming (IP) is a mathematical optimization technique that deals with linear programming problems where some or all of the variables are restricted to take integer values. It is a subfield of algebra and operations research, and it is used to model and solve a wide range of real-world problems, such as scheduling, resource allocation, transportation, and supply chain management.  In an integer programming problem, the objective is to optimize a linear function of variables, subject to a set of linear constraints, while ensuring that the variables take integer values. The general form of an integer programming problem can be represented as follows:  Objective function: Maximize or minimize Z = c1 * x1 + c2 * x2 + ... + cn * xn  Subject to constraints: a11 * x1 + a12 * x2 + ... + a1n * xn ≤ b1 a21 * x1 + a22 * x2 + ... + a2n * xn ≤ b2 ... am1 * x1 + am2 * x2 + ... + amn * xn ≤ bm  And integer restrictions: x1, x2, ..., xn ∈ Z (integer values)  Here, Z is the objective function to be maximized or minimized, xi (i = 1, 2, ..., n) are the decision variables, ci are the coefficients of the objective function, aij are the coefficients of the constraints, and bi are the constraint limits.  Integer programming problems can be classified into different types based on the nature of the integer restrictions:  1. Pure Integer Programming (PIP): All decision variables are required to be integers. 2. Mixed Integer Programming (MIP): Some decision variables are required to be integers, while others can take continuous values. 3. Binary Integer Programming (BIP) or 0-1 Integer Programming: All decision variables are binary, i.e., they can take only 0 or 1 values.  Solving integer programming problems can be computationally challenging, especially for large-scale problems, as the search space for integer solutions can be vast. Various algorithms and techniques, such as branch and bound, cutting planes, and heuristics, have been developed to efficiently solve integer programming problems.", "answer": "[2, 0]"}
{"question": "Title: Big Star Background: Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel. The group broke up in 1974, and reorganized with a new line-up nearly 20 years later. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the vocal harmonies of the Beatles, as well as the swaggering rhythms of the Rolling Stones and the jangling guitars of the Byrds. To the resulting power pop, Big Star added dark, existential themes, and produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Section: Second era: 1993-2010 Passage: Big Star returned in 1993 with a new line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, \"We were working out the set list and we went to this little cafe. Little did I know we'd be playing that set for the next ten years\". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.  Big Star's first post-reunion studio recording was the song \"Hot Thing\", recorded in the mid-1990s for the Big Star tribute album Big Star, Small . As with their prior studio release, however, the tribute album was delayed for years due to its record company going under. Originally scheduled for a 1998 release on Ignition Records, the album was eventually released in 2006 on Koch Records.  In Space was released on September 27, 2005 on the Rykodisc label. Recorded during 2004, the album consisted of new material mostly co-written by Chilton, Stephens, Auer, and Stringfellow. Reviewing In Space, Rolling Stone's David Fricke first pointed out that the context of the release was now \"a world expecting that American Beatles ideal all over again\" from a band that \"achieved its power-pop perfection when no one else was looking.\" In Fricke's estimation, this seemingly unrealistic expectation was met in part: \"It's here - in the jangly longing and ice-wall harmonies of 'Lady Sweet'\" - however, Fricke found that the successful songs were interleaved with \"the eccentric R&B and demo-quality glam rock that have made Chilton's solo records a mixed blessing,\" and that \"'A Whole New Thing' starts out like old T.Rex, then goes nowhere special.\" Warming nevertheless to \"the rough sunshine\" of \"Best Chance\", Fricke concluded, \"In Space is no   Question: How did the lineup change in the second era?

{"question": "What are the generators of the additive cyclic group Z? Relevant Theorem: In group theory, a generating set of a group is a subset of the group's elements such that every element of the group can be expressed as a finite combination of these elements and their inverses. In other words, a generating set is a collection of elements that can be used to \"build\" the entire group through the group operation (e.g., multiplication, addition, etc.) and taking inverses.  A group G is said to be generated by a set S if every element of G can be obtained by applying the group operation to the elements of S and their inverses, possibly multiple times. The set S is then called a generating set of G. If a group has a finite generating set, it is called finitely generated.  For example, consider the group of integers under addition, denoted as (Z, +). The set {1, -1} is a generating set for this group, as every integer can be expressed as a sum of 1's and/or -1's. Another generating set for the same group is {2, 3}, as every integer can be expressed as a linear combination of 2 and 3.  A group can have multiple generating sets, and the size of the smallest generating set is called the rank of the group. A group with a single element as its generating set is called a cyclic group.  In summary, a generating set of a group is a subset of the group's elements that can be used to construct the entire group through the group operation and taking inverses. Generating sets are essential in understanding the structure and properties of groups in group theory.", "answer": "[1, -1]"}

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   CD28 is one of the most important costimulatory receptors necessary for full T lymphocyte activation. The CD28 receptor can enhance T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signals, as well as deliver independent signals. Indeed, CD28 engagement by B7 can generate TCR-independent signals leading to IkappaB kinase and NF-kappaB activation. Here we demonstrate that the TCR-independent CD28 signal leads to the selective transcription of survival (Bcl-xL) and inflammatory (IL-8 and B cell activation factor, but not proliferative (IL-2), genes, in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner. CD28-stimulated T cells actively secrete IL-8, and Bcl-xL up-regulation protects T cells from radiation-induced apoptosis. The transcription of CD28-induced genes is mediated by the specific recruitment of RelA and p52 NF-kappaB subunits to target promoters. In contrast, p50 and c-Rel, which preferentially bind NF-kappaB sites on the IL-2 gene promoter after anti-CD3 stimulation, are not involved. Thus, we identify CD28 as a key regulator of genes important for both survival and inflammation.", "answer": "CD28 delivers a unique signal leading to the selective recruitment of RelA and p52 NF-kappaB subunits on IL-8 and Bcl-xL gene promoters."}

{"question": "Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.   Context: Pollution that enters water at just one point is called point source pollution. For example, chemicals from a factory might empty into a stream through a pipe or set of pipes (see Figure 21.9). Pollution that enters in many places is called non-point source pollution. This means that the pollution is from multiple sources. With non-point source pollution, runoff may carry the pollution into a body of water. Which type of pollution do you think is harder to control? There are three main sources of water pollution: 1. Agriculture. 2. Industry. 3. Municipal, or community, sources. Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure 21.10). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Waste from livestock can also pollute water. The waste contains bacteria and other organisms that cause disease. In fact, more than 40 human diseases can be caused by water polluted with animal waste. Many farms in the U.S. have thousands of animals. These farms produce millions of gallons of waste. The waste is stored in huge lagoons, like the one in Figure 21.11. Unfortunately, many leaks from these lagoons have occurred. Two examples are described below. In North Carolina, 25 million gallons of hog manure spilled into a nearby river. The contaminated water killed Factories and power plants may pollute water with harmful substances. Many industries produce toxic chemicals. Some of the worst are arsenic, lead, and mercury. Nuclear power plants produce radioactive chemicals. They cause cancer and other serious health problems. Oil tanks and pipelines can leak. Leaks may not be noticed until a lot of oil has soaked into the ground. The oil may pollute groundwater so it is no longer fit to drink. Municipal refers to the community. Households and businesses in a community are also responsible for polluting the water supply. For example: People apply chemicals to their lawns. The chemicals may be picked up by rainwater. The contaminated runoff enters storm sewers and ends up in nearby rivers or lakes. Underground septic tanks can develop leaks. This lets household sewage seep into groundwater. Municipal sewage treatment plants dump treated wastewater into rivers or lakes. Sometimes the wastewater is not treated enough and contains bacteria or toxic chemicals. The oceans are vast. You might think they are too big to be harmed by pollution. But thats not the case. Ocean water is becoming seriously polluted. The oceans are most polluted along coasts. Why do you think thats the case? Of course, its because most pollution enters the oceans from the land. Runoff and rivers carry the majority of pollution into the ocean. Many cities dump their wastewater directly into coastal waters. In some parts of the world, raw sewage and trash may be thrown into the water (see Figure 21.12). Coastal water may become so polluted that people get sick if they swim in it or eat seafood from it. The polluted water may also kill fish and other ocean life. Oil spills are another source of ocean pollution. To get at oil buried beneath the seafloor, oil rigs are built in the oceans. These rigs pump oil from beneath the ocean floor. Huge ocean tankers carry oil around the world. If something goes wrong with a rig on a tanker, millions of barrels of oil may end up in the water. The oil may coat and kill ocean animals. Some of the oil will wash ashore. This oil may destroy coastal wetlands and ruin beaches. Figure 21.13 shows an oil spill on a beach. The oil washed ashore after a deadly oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Thermal pollution is pollution that raises the temperature of water.

{"question": "Title: Marc Márquez Background: Marc Marquez Alenta (born 17 February 1993) is a Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and four-time MotoGP world champion. Marquez races for Honda's factory team since his MotoGP debut in 2013. Nicknamed the \"Ant of Cervera\", he is one of four riders to have won world championship titles in three different categories, after Mike Hailwood, Phil Read and Valentino Rossi. Marquez won the 2010 125cc World Championship, the 2012 Moto2 World Championship, and the 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017 MotoGP World Championships. Section: Moto2 World Championship Passage: Marquez moved into the Moto2 class for 2011 - the first of an expected two-year deal - as the sole rider of the new team Monlau Competicion, run by his manager Emilio Alzamora. He finished 21st in Portugal, before taking his first victory in the class at the French Grand Prix. At his home race in Catalonia, Marquez finished second behind championship leader Stefan Bradl, before another fall at the Silverstone, having started from his first Moto2 pole position. With Bradl taking his fourth victory in the first six races, Marquez trailed him by 82 points at the end of the weekend. Marquez made a mid-season surge up the championship standings, winning six of the next seven races to move within six points of Bradl in the championship standings.  In the Japanese Grand Prix, Marquez took his seventh pole position of the season but finished second to Andrea Iannone, but that finish combined with a fourth place for Bradl, allowed Marquez to take the championship lead by a point. At the Australian Grand Prix, Marquez was involved in an incident with Ratthapark Wilairot during free practice; Marquez crashed into the back of Wilairot after the session had been concluded, and for riding in an \"irresponsible manner\", was given a one-minute time penalty onto his qualifying time. The penalty ensured Marquez would start the race from last on the grid, but he made his way through the field and eventually finished the race in third place.  Prior to the Malaysian Grand Prix, Marquez confirmed that he would remain in Moto2 for the 2012 season, after rumours of a move into the MotoGP class. Marquez's race weekend was hampered in the opening minutes of the first free practice session, as he crashed on a damp patch of asphalt. After sitting out two further practice sessions, Marquez completed two laps in the qualifying session, but his times were only good enough for 36th on the grid. He did not start the race, as he failed a medical examination prior to the warm-up on race morning. Marquez attended the final race of the season in Valencia, in the hope of being fit to compete, but withdrew due to his continued vision problems, giving Bradl the title.  In 2012, Marquez won the Moto2 championship title after a season-long battle with fellow Spanish rider Pol Espargaro; a third-place finish for Marquez at the Australian Grand Prix - despite a win for Espargaro - was enough to give him his second world title before moving into the premier class for the 2013 season. He took his last victory in the class at the Valencian Grand Prix, the last event of the season, despite starting from 33rd on the grid. This performance, which implied overtaking 20 bikes on the first lap alone, meant the biggest comeback in the sport's history. He finished the season with nine race wins, setting a record for the class that still stands. Marquez's result was enough to give Suter the constructors' title for the class.

Label the instances as \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and label them as \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future.   Tl;dr at the bottom. It's a long story. I (19F) met this guy (24M) a little over a month ago on Tinder. We started off great, had lots of dates... all in all, everything was going good. On our first date, he told practically told me his life story, ending with him saying he came here on a student visa when he was 20 and overstayed. I assumed this meant that he wasn't legal in the US and pretty much accepted it. Honestly wasn't expecting it to have any bearings on our relationship so soon: Either we were going to break up before it made a difference or we would actually work out and get to the end goal for every relationship, in which case, that would make him legal anyway (yes, I understand that immigration laws are way more complicated than this, but I'm dumbing it down for the sake of the post).  Fast forward to last week, he cancels a date and reschedules it for a few days after. And then he drops the bomb - \"I think this should be our last date\" and that he would explain everything then. Mind you, I do not love this man (after a month, that would be a bit insane), but I liked how we were together, so I was definitely a bit hurt about things possibly ending so abruptly with little to no reason.  I did speculate that it was because of his immigration issue, but I help off in really trying to ask him about it until we met. When we do, he tells me exactly what I thought: the judge rejected his change of status and his lawyer told him he essentially had to marry someone to stay here. He goes on to say that he wants to end things because he doesn't want to go behind my back and date someone else with the intention of being with them for much longer than a few months. Then he ends with the obligatory, \"let's be friends.\"   I have to say I was pissed off and maybe not for the reason most people would think. I've only known him for a month, but I am the type of person who only date people I can see a future with, so I was hurt that he thought he couldn't see a future for us. He actually ended up denying that eventually, but he was vehement on continuing to being friends. I kept rebutting his point because, imo, I didn't think he thought it through thoroughly (it was just 3 days after he got the news).   So I give him another option: what if we continue what we have, with the intention of getting married, but with the understanding that if we don't end up actually lasting, I would still help him with his situation. Just to be clear, we would have to be married for a minimum of 3-4 years for him to become legal. All of this also came with the understanding that if we did end up breaking up (but not divorcing) within those 4 years, we could date other people and stay married until we could get divorced and he could stay in the US.   We ended the date with the us agreeing to take a month off of seeing each other (but still communicating with texts that are very relarionship-y)  to really understand the implications of what we would be doing. I should also add that we ended with a few kisses too, so the relationship was a bit recovered, but with a lot of uncertainty. We both decided that we would make the decision of what to do individually, then meet up again to discuss.  So here's my dilemma: WIBTA if I decided to essentially take back my suggestion and just ask to be friends? I haven't completely made my decision yet, but if I do make that decision to not go through with it, would I be?  Tl;dr - A friend/potential boyfriend of mine is having immigration problems and I offered to be his potential wife for the next 3-4 years so he could become legal. WIBTA if I backtracked on that offer?  Please feel free to ask any questions that would help. I hope I gave enough information though.", "answer": "HYPOTHETICAL"}

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   The prediction of novel pre-microRNA (miRNA) from genomic sequence has received considerable attention recently. However, the majority of studies have focused on the human genome. Previous studies have demonstrated that sensitivity (correctly detecting true miRNA) is sustained when human-trained methods are applied to other species, however they have failed to report the dramatic drop in specificity (the ability to correctly reject non-miRNA sequences) in non-human genomes. Considering the ratio of true miRNA sequences to pseudo-miRNA sequences is on the order of 1:1000, such low specificity prevents the application of most existing tools to non-human genomes, as the number of false positives overwhelms the true predictions. We here introduce a framework (SMIRP) for creating species-specific miRNA prediction systems, leveraging sequence conservation and phylogenetic distance information. Substantial improvements in specificity and precision are obtained for four non-human test species when our framework is applied to three different prediction systems representing two types of classifiers (support vector machine and Random Forest), based on three different feature sets, with both human-specific and taxon-wide training data. The SMIRP framework is potentially applicable to all miRNA prediction systems and we expect substantial improvement in precision and specificity, while sustaining sensitivity, independent of the machine learning technique chosen.", "answer": "A framework for improving microRNA prediction in non-human genomes"}

{"question": "Title: Dana Rohrabacher Background: Rohrabacher, who is of German and English descent, was born June 21, 1947, in Coronado, California, the son of Doris M. (nee Haring) and Donald Tyler Rohrabacher. He attended elementary school locally, and during his college years, he lived in Sunset Beach. Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California. Section: Global warming Passage: Rohrabacher doubts that global warming is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by \"dinosaur flatulence\": \"In fact, it is assumed at best to be unproven and at worst a liberal claptrap, trendy, but soon to go out of style in our new Congress.\" Politico and the New York Times reported that on May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming and suggested that, if global warming is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and replanting. These reports sparked strong criticism by some scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the University of Leeds. They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming. In response, Rohrabacher stated,  Once again those with a global agenda have created a straw man by misrepresenting the position of their critics. I do not believe that CO2 is a cause of global warming, nor have I ever advocated the reduction of CO2 through the clearing of rainforests or cutting down older trees to prevent global warming. But that is how my question to a witness during my subcommittee hearing on May 25th is being reported. I simply asked the witness, Dr. Todd Stern, who is a supporter of a global climate treaty that would dramatically hurt the standard of living for millions of human beings, if he was considering a policy that would address naturally emitted carbon dioxide, which makes up over 90% of emissions. To suggest that I'm advocating such a radical approach instead of simply questioning the policy is a total misrepresentation of my position.  Rohrabacher does not believe that global warming is a problem. At a town hall meeting with the Newport Mesa Tea Party in August 2013, Rohrabacher said \"global warming is a total fraud\" and part of a \"game plan\" by liberals to \"create global government\". CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was the relation between Dana and Global warming? Answer: Rohrabacher doubts that global warming is caused by humans. Question: Did he create any movement that was againt it? Answer: 2013, Rohrabacher said \"global warming is a total fraud\" and part of a \"game plan\" by liberals to \"create global government\".

POST : Hi,  Just yesterday I was out with my girlfriend and our puppy and we stumbled upon 3 moose about 100-200 yards away standing in a tight group. They were all facing us (clearly having seen us) and me being unsure if I can trust our puppy to stay calm and collected and not potentially make the moose feel territorial and stir up some shit, I said \"Let's go back. Those are moose, and we shouldn't mess with them.\"  to which my girlfriend (having seen no moose in her life) says \"Woww, no! Let's stay and look at them!\" and starts walking a bit closer, at which point I again try to interject with \"No, for real. Don't mess with moose, they're not nice animals. I'm turning around and leaving right now and you should come too.\" at which point I grabbed our puppy and started leaving, turning back toward her and saying \"Come!\" once before we more briskly walk away.  On the walk back when she a few minutes later (fuming and being pissed) joined us I explained what I expected could happen (moose being somewhat territorial by nature, puppy starts barking, moose gets testy, get closer and something bad happens) and she doesn't address this at all and just says \"I can't believe you did that!\"  Now my girlfriend is annoyed at me for \"abandoning\" her. Her first argument was that the situation was fine and that people go closer to moose all the time, but then when I pointed out that other people doing risky stuff is no excuse to do risky things she switched to that I abandoned her and that I'm an asshole for it.   From my perspective, if she wanted to stay, fine, she's free to make her own decisions as long as she's informed that they're risky. But I needed to get our unpredictable puppy out of there that might have caused a dangerous situation simply because he doesn't know better and could have endangered us all.  I do understand her point of view. Being 'abandoned' is not a pleasant experience no matter the circumstances, but from my point of view I told her that we were turning around and leaving and why about 3 times before actually doing so, and she decided against it and made her own decision. I don't feel like I'm obliged to make the same mistakes as her just because she doesn't want to follow my lead.  Am I the asshole? I feel like I probably am an asshole for being so unfeeling about it, but at the same time I do not regret in the least how I acted because I've lived in moose-heavy areas before and I know they're nothing to play around with and am not about to get peer pressured into making a stupid decision.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "Title: Nathan Buckley Background: Nathan Charles Buckley (born 26 July 1972) is a former professional Australian rules football player, commentator and coach, best known for his time as captain of the Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. Section: Coaching career Passage: After months of speculation, Buckley signed a 5-year deal with the Collingwood Football Club. He was the assistant coach for the seasons of 2010 and 2011; he then became head coach in 2012, having taken over from Mick Malthouse, initially signing for a period of three years.  Collingwood began the 2012 season shakily, losing to Hawthorn in round 1 and being thrashed by Carlton in round 3. However they recovered to win their next ten matches and finish the home-and-away season in fourth place with a record of 16-6. They were defeated by Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final before bouncing back to defeat West Coast in the Semi Final. However they lost comfortably to eventual premier Sydney in the Preliminary Final at ANZ Stadium to bring an end to the 2012 season.  2013 started poorly for the Magpies, slumping to a 5-4 record after 9 games. They couldn't quite find the consistency of previous seasons and finished the year in sixth place with a 14-8 record. They played Port Adelaide in their Elimination Final at the MCG and slumped to a shock 24-point loss, which caused Buckley to call into question the club's culture.  Buckley's contract was extended until the end of 2016 by Collingwood in early March 2014, however Collingwood produced a poor performance in round 1 and lost to 2013 grand finalists Fremantle by 70 points. They ended up missing the finals to finish 12th partly due to an injury crisis. Collingwood started the 2015 season at 3-1 as of Round 4 and a gutsy win against Essendon on Anzac Day in 100th centenary of Gallipoli landing.  At the end of Collingwood's 2017 season on 28 August 2017, Buckley was given a two-year contract extension by the club after it undertook a review of the entire football club.

{"question": "Title: Architects (British band) Background: Architects are a British metalcore band from Brighton, East Sussex. The band currently consists of vocalist Sam Carter, drummer Dan Searle, bassist Alex Dean and guitarists Adam Christianson and Josh Middleton. The band's first name was Inharmonic, which was swiftly changed to Counting the Days, and finally to Architects after a couple of years. They have released seven studio albums and one split EP with Dead Swans to date. Section: Musical style Passage: Architects have been referred to as being \"pumped with both controlled rage and unhindered heart, accessible and ambitious, aggressive and beautiful\". Considered alongside Enter Shikari as offering metalcore style to more mainstream audiences they have been described as metalcore, technical metal and progressive metalcore. Their music is characterised by choppy, complex guitar riffs, the use of obscure time signatures and rhythmic breakdowns, and for their guitarists alternating between a \"down-tuned rumble\" and \"melodic punk\" during songs. However the band's music isn't solely based upon technical proficiency and does use catchy riffs and choruses.  Architects have made various stylistic transitions and evolutions throughout their career, with the band citing their belief that each album should be distinct. On their second album Ruin, the band's sound was heavier and darker sound than on Nightmares. Hollow Crown maintains the aggression and technical proficiency of Ruin while incorporating more melody, catchy riffs and use of singing. The band also used synthesised instruments such as keyboards and drum machines. The guitars were tuned to Drop B with the lowest string at Ab, giving the \"ability to create a really heavy low end sound on the bottom but still give a comfortable degree of tension on the higher strings.\" A prime example of their signature style is the song 'We're All Alone', with its technical, progressive guitar riffs and heavy, hardcore punk-influenced rhythmic breakdowns.  Their fourth album 'The Here and Now' represented a stylistic shift from their previous work considered \"ultimately subjective\" and \"their most diverse\". Described as going in a \"clean-cut post-hardcore\" direction, The Here and Now favours singing over screaming, anthemic choruses and hooks. The album still retains elements of their previous albums, however, including \"tortured howls, frenzied riffs, and earth-shattering rhythms, albeit with a slightly more mainstream edge.\" The album includes the melancholy, glitchy electronica-based 'An Open Letter To Myself' and the rock ballad 'Heartburn' both lead into \"rousing, fist-pumping choruses\".  The band's fifth album Daybreaker featured something of a return to the heavier, more aggressive style of their previous albums, balancing this with the melody and hooks of The Here and Now. Daybreaker also features even more melodic, atmospheric tracks than usual, such as 'Truth Be Told, 'Behind The Throne' and 'Unbeliever'.  After the release of Daybreaker the band grew confident in playing much heavier music again, and cited that the key influence on the heavier style of their sixth album was to create the best songs for live shows. The album also incorporates blastbeats, which have not been used in any of the band's recordings since Hollow Crown. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What are the musical influences of the band Architects? Answer: down-tuned rumble\" and \"melodic punk Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer: The album also incorporates blastbeats, which have not been used in any of the band's recordings since Hollow Crown. Question: What else is distinctive about their sound? Answer: The band also used synthesised instruments such as keyboards and drum machines. Question: How has their style evolved?", "answer": "Their fourth album 'The Here and Now' represented a stylistic shift from their previous work considered \"ultimately subjective\" and \"their most diverse\"."}

{"question": "Title: Alexander Graham Bell Background: Alexander Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847. The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845-70) and Edward Charles Bell (1848-67), both of whom would die of tuberculosis. His father was Professor Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician, and his mother was Eliza Grace (nee Symonds). Section: First experiments with sound Passage: His father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton developed by Sir Charles Wheatstone based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The rudimentary \"mechanical man\" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a \"big prize\" if they were successful. While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could \"speak\", albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the \"lips\" and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable \"Mama\" ensued, to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.  Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, \"Trouve\". After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding \"Ow ah oo ga ma ma\". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate \"How are you, grandma?\" Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a \"talking dog\". These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance.  At age 19, Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist Alexander Ellis, a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in Pygmalion). Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of Hermann von Helmholtz's work, The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music.  Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork \"contraption\", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: \"Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech.\" He also later remarked: \"I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was his first experiment with sound?

{"question": "Title: Jim Jarmusch Background: Jarmusch was born January 22, 1953, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the middle of three children of middle-class suburbanites. His mother, of German and Irish descent, had been a reviewer of film and theatre for the Akron Beacon Journal before marrying his father, a businessman of Czech and German descent who worked for the B.F. Goodrich Company. She introduced Jarmusch to the world of cinema by leaving him at a local cinema to watch matinee double features such as Attack of the Crab Monsters and Creature From the Black Lagoon while she ran errands. The first adult film he recalls seeing was the 1958 cult classic Thunder Road, the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch. Section: Down by Law, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth Passage: In 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directed Down by Law, starring musicians John Lurie and Tom Waits, and Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni (his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse. Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, this constructivist neo-noir was Jarmusch's first collaboration with Dutch cinematographer Robby Muller, who had been known for his work with Wenders.  His next two films each experimented with parallel narratives: Mystery Train (1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a small Memphis hotel, and Night on Earth (1991) involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki. Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work, Mystery Train nevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America. He wrote Night on Earth in about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni, Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder and Isaach de Bankole.  As a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the American road movie. Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences, gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan. Each of the four films had its premiere at the New York Film Festival, while Mystery Train was in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic and auteur status fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness of Mystery Train and Night On Earth, the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion.  A film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedy Leningrad Cowboys Go America further solidified his interest and participation in the road movie genre. In 1991 Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television series Fishing With John. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Was Down by Law well received by critics?

{"question": "Title: Geoff Tate Background: Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate, January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey) is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensryche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. Section: Controversy Passage: Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding the split with Queensryche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre).  Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012. Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd \"You guys suck,\" which his bandmates, as well as some fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration \"I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them.\" He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: \"It's just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn't respect the fans' type of thing.\" He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: \"I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate.\"  During the \"Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour\" tour, ten minutes into a show in St. Charles, Illinois on May 17, 2013, Tate grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.On the subject, Tate commented: \"Some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy].\" He accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.  Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the Queensryche lawsuits, saying: \"I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was the controversy about?

{"question": "Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.   Context: The film is concerned chiefly with four topics: Chemno, where mobile gas vans were first used by Germans to exterminate Jews; the death camps of Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau; and the Warsaw Ghetto, with testimonies from survivors, witnesses, and perpetrators. The sections on Treblinka include testimony from Abraham Bomba, who survived as a barber;[5] Richard Glazar, an inmate; and Franz Suchomel, an SS officer who worked at the camp, who reveals intricate details of the camp's gas chamber. Bomba breaks down while describing how a barber friend of his came across his wife and sister while cutting hair in an anteroom of the gas chamber. Suchomel states he did not know about extermination at Treblinka until he arrived there. This section includes Henryk Gawkowski, who said he drove one of the transport trains while intoxicated with vodka. Gawkowski's photograph appears on the poster used for the film's marketing campaign. Testimonies on Auschwitz are provided by Rudolf Vrba, who escaped from the camp before the end of the war; and Filip Muller, who worked in an incinerator burning the bodies from the gassings. Muller recounts what prisoners said to him, and describes the experience of personally going into the gas chamber: bodies were piled up by the doors 'like stones'. He breaks down as he recalls the prisoners starting to sing while being forced into the gas chamber. Accounts include some from local villagers, who witnessed trains heading daily to the camp and returning empty; they quickly guessed the fate of those on board. Lanzmann also interviews bystanders. He asks whether they knew what was going on in the death camps. Their answers reveal that they did but they justified their inaction by the fear of death. Two survivors of Chemno are interviewed: Simon Srebnik, who was forced to sing military songs to entertain the Nazis; and Mordechai Podchlebnik. Lanzmann also has a secretly filmed interview with Franz Schalling, a German security guard, who describes the workings of Chemno. Walter Stier, a former Nazi bureaucrat, describes the workings of the railways. Stier insists he was too busy managing railroad traffic to notice his trains were transporting Jews to their deaths. The Warsaw ghetto is described by Jan Karski, who worked for the Polish government-in-exile and Franz Grassler, a Nazi administrator who liaised with Jewish leaders. A Christian, Karski snuck into the Warsaw ghetto and escaped to England to try to convince the Allied governments to intervene more strongly on behalf of the Jews, but failed to do so. Memories from Jewish survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising conclude the documentary. Lanzmann also interviews Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, who discusses the historical significance of Nazi propaganda against the European Jews, and the Nazi development of the Final Solution. The complete text of the film was published in 1985. The man in the poster[edit] During his trip to Poland in July 1978, Lanzmann's crew filmed his conversations with an elderly Polish man by the name of Henryk Gawkowski, who, some 35 years earlier, had worked on the locomotives pulling Holocaust trains to Treblinka during World War II.[6] The photograph used for the film poster shows Gawkoski on a locomotive to Treblinka, but there was no reconstruction of events from his youth: the type of locomotives used in 1943 were different, as was the landscape. The female translator insists on calling him the train's operator (or conductor in Polish); nevertheless, Gawkowski informed that he only shoveled coal into the engine's firebox, and that two German officers were always on every train. What happened to the victims, Gawkowski said, was not his fault, adding emphatically that if he had the opportunity, he would have been the first to slash Hitler's throat.[6]   Question: What were some of director Claude Lanzmann's interviews of his subjects filmed in?", "answer": "holocaust"}
{"question": "Title: Blackfoot Confederacy Background: The Blackfoot Confederacy, Niitsitapi or Siksikaitsitapi (nitmowmeko, meaning \"the people\" or \"Blackfoot-speaking real people\") is a historic collective name for the four bands that make up the Blackfoot or Blackfeet people: three First Nation band governments in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, and one federally recognized Native American tribe in Montana, United States. The Siksika (\"Blackfoot\"), the Kainai or Kainah (\"Blood\"), and the Northern Piegan or Peigan or Piikani (\"Apa'tosee\" or \"Poor Robes\") reside in Canada; the Southern Piegan/Piegan Blackfeet (\"Amskapi Piikani\" or Pikuni) are located in the United States, where they are also known as the Blackfeet Nation. In modern use, the term is sometimes used only for the three First Nations in Canada. Historically, the member peoples of the Confederacy were nomadic bison hunters and trout fishermen, who ranged across large areas of the northern Great Plains of western North America, specifically the semi-arid shortgrass prairie ecological region. Section: Importance and uses of bison Passage: The Niitsitapi main source of food on the plains was the American bison (buffalo), the largest mammal in North America, standing about 6 1/2 feet (2.0 m) tall and weighing up to 2,000 pounds (910 kg). Before the introduction of horses, the Niitsitapi needed other ways to get in range. The buffalo jump was one of the most common ways. The hunters would round up the buffalo into V-shaped pens, and drive them over a cliff (they hunted pronghorn antelopes in the same way). Afterwords the hunters would go to the bottom and take as much meat as they could carry back to camp. They also used camouflage for hunting. The hunters would take buffalo skins from previous hunting trips and drape them over their bodies to blend in and mask their scent. By subtle moves, the hunters could get close to the herd. When close enough, the hunters would attack with arrows or spears to kill wounded animals.  The people used virtually all parts of the body and skin. The women prepared the meat for food: by boiling, roasting or drying for jerky. This processed it to last a long time without spoiling, and they depended on bison meat to get through the winters. The winters were long, harsh, and cold due to the lack of trees in the Plains, so people stockpiled meat in summer. As a ritual, hunters often ate the bison heart minutes after the kill. The women tanned and prepared the skins to cover the tepees. These were made of log poles, with the skins draped over it. The tepee remained warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and was a great shield against the wind.  The women also made clothing from the skins, such as robes and moccasins, and made soap from the fat. Both men and women made utensils, sewing needles and tools from the bones, using tendon for fastening and binding. The stomach and bladder were cleaned and prepared for use for storing liquids. Dried bison dung was fuel for the fires. The Niitsitapi considered the animal sacred and integral to their lives. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what was the importance and uses of bison? Answer: The Niitsitapi considered the animal sacred and integral to their lives. Question: how did they use bison? Answer: The Niitsitapi main source of food on the plains was the American bison Question: if it was sacred, why did they eat it? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: how else did they use bison?

Background Paragraph: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk.  Story: Two twin sisters, Bianca and Rosa, were exposed to high levels of air pollution. While Bianca was exposed mostly to indoor pollution, Rosa was heavily exposed to outdoor pollution.  Question: Which sister was more exposed to air pollution from school?", "answer": "Bianca."}

The Lancashire comedian was known for performing with his \"little ukulele\" and made the instrument famous. The Keech, played by Formby in his 1935 film No Limit, and Dallas D banjo were part of Formby fan George Johnson's collection until his death last year. Mr Johnson kept most of his Formby mementos hidden under his bed and in the attic so as not to anger his wife.

I even visit his grave in Warrington cemetery. \"I knew the ukulele was up for sale and just wanted it.\" Mr Mason bought the instrument for almost £12,500 at Hansons Auctioneers, in Etwall, Derbyshire. The Keech sold for about £11,500. The pair of ukuleles had a guide price of £19,000. Claire Howell, music memorabilia expert at Hansons, said: \"These are incredible instruments to own with a rich provenance and pedigree.\" Mr Johnson, from Gateshead, who died last summer at the age of 91, collected the memorabilia from the 1930s.

{"question": "Title: Lewis H. Morgan Background: Lewis Henry Morgan (November 21, 1818 - December 17, 1881) was a pioneering American anthropologist and social theorist who worked as a railroad lawyer. He is best known for his work on kinship and social structure, his theories of social evolution, and his ethnography of the Iroquois. Interested in what holds societies together, he proposed the concept that the earliest human domestic institution was the matrilineal clan, not the patriarchal family. Also interested in what leads to social change, he was a contemporary of the European social theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who were influenced by reading his work on social structure and material culture, the influence of technology on progress. Section: Early life and education Passage: Lewis' grandfather, Thomas Morgan of Connecticut, had been a Continental soldier in the Revolutionary War. Afterward he and his family migrated west to New York's Finger Lakes region, where he bought land from the Cayuga people and planted a farm on the shores of Lake Cayuga near Aurora. He and his wife already had three sons, including Jedediah, the future father of Lewis; and a daughter.  In 1797, Jedediah Morgan (1774-1826) married Amanda Stanton, settling on a 100-acre gift of land from his father. After she had five children and died, Jedediah married Harriet Steele of Hartford, Connecticut. They had eight more children, including Lewis. As an adult, he adopted the middle initial \"H.\"  Lewis later decided that this H, if anything, stood for \"Henry\".  A multi-skilled Yankee, Jedediah Morgan invented a plow and formed a business partnership to manufacture parts for it; he built a blast furnace for the factory. He moved to Aurora, leaving the farm to a son. After joining the Masons, he helped to form the first Masonic lodge in Aurora. Elected a state senator, Morgan supported the construction of the Erie Canal, which opened in 1825.  At his death in 1826, Jedediah left 500 acres with herds and flocks in trust for the support of his family. This provided for education as well. Lewis studied classical subjects at Cayuga Academy: Latin, Greek, rhetoric and mathematics. His father had bequeathed money specifically for his college education, after giving land to the other children for their occupations. Lewis chose Union College in Schenectady. Due to his work at Cayuga Academy, Lewis finished college in two years, 1838-1840, graduating at age 22. The curriculum continued study of classics combined with science, especially mechanics and optics. Lewis was strongly interested in the works of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier.  Eliphalet Nott, the president of Union College, was an inventor of stoves and a boiler; he held 31 patents. A Presbyterian minister, he kept the young men under a tight discipline, forbidding alcoholic beverages and requiring students to get permission to go to town. He held up the Bible as the one practical standard for all behavior. His career ended with some notoriety when he was investigated by the state for attempting to raise funds for the college through a lottery. The students evaded his strict regime by founding secret (and forbidden) fraternities, such as the Kappa Alpha Society. Lewis Morgan joined in 1839. CANNOTANSWER  Question: where was he born?

A side effect of the advancement of gadgets and networks into our daily lives is lingering concern those devices will one day fail us; even the cellular phone was (in the not-so-distant past) eyed with some skepticism by first responders. Accordingly, the notion police or paramedics are best summoned via landline due to its long-developed and trustworthy capabilities remains despite the popularity and ubiquitousness of mobile phones. Landlines are are thought to make it easier to track down a person in need of assistance — and in films or on television, mobiles seem to regularly fail in moments of high tension (clip contains some profanity):  Various versions of that rumor have circulated in both the United States and the United Kingdom, dating back to at least 2006. The rumor’s functionality exists on at least two levels: one cautioning against inadvertently summoning the police (leading at best to embarrassment and at worst, actual harm), and another reassuring people (inaccurately) that even if you cannot complete a call for help, the cavalry will eventually arrive all the same. The latter notion is one where belief in the claim presents a risk, suggesting that one need only knock a landline off its receiver to eventually summon first responders. We contacted the Federal Communications Commission, which referred us to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA): As The Voice of 9-1-1™, NENA is on the forefront of all emergency communications issues. The association serves its members and the greater public safety community as the only professional organization solely focused on 9-1-1 policy, technology, operations, and education issues. With more than 9,000 members in 48 chapters across the United States and around the globe, NENA promotes the implementation and awareness of 9-1-1, as well as international three-digit emergency communications systems … Through the association’s efforts to provide effective and efficient public safety solutions, NENA strives to protect human life, preserve property, and maintain the security of our communities. A NENA representative told us he was unfamiliar with the rumor, adding that to the best of his knowledge a “presented dial tone will time out and the line will become inaccessible to inbound calls.”  (Or, to put it another way, a “busy signal.”)  Until the mid-2000s, mobile phones were largely considered a secondary form of contact to be used sparingly in the absence of a landline, and fixed-location phones were often inadvertently or (perhaps more often) deliberately left “off the hook” to disable incoming calls — a not uncommon occurrence, as one New York Times writer lamented in 2012: But there was also another part of the Friday night ritual — very likely the most important part. “Nick, go and take the phone off the hook,” my father would command. I’d excitedly rush into the hallway, lift up the phone receiver, and toss it to the floor. Then, I’d race back into the living room before showtime. As the opening credits for the movie began, the phone left off the hook would echo in the hall: Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep … and then, silence. No way to answer the phone, and no way to leave a message, meant that no one could get through. And rightly so: it was movie night, after all. Claim: A landline disengaged from its cradle will eventually self-dial 911.", "answer": "0"}

{"question": "Title: Merchandise Mart Background: The Merchandise Mart (or the Merch Mart, or the Mart) is a commercial building located in the downtown Loop, of Chicago, Illinois, United States. When it opened in 1930, it was the largest building in the world, with 4,000,000 square feet (372,000 m2) of floor space. The art deco landmark is located at the junction of the Chicago River's branches. The building is a leading retailing and wholesale destination, hosting 20,000 visitors and tenants per day as of the late 2000s. Section: Green building practices Passage: Under Chris Kennedy's leadership of the Mart, it was the largest building in the world to be awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification in 2007 from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). The Mart has long been implementing sustainable practices. The Mart Center began operating a thermal storage facility in 1986, capable of building 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of ice per night, cooling 71 buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, and saving $200,000 in electricity costs in the first year.  In 1990, the Mart Center began using Green Seal-approved green cleaning products and the next year implemented a recycling program, which today includes all forms of paper products, glass, light bulbs, batteries, aluminum and construction materials. In 1996, the Mart Center became one of the first major property owners in downtown Chicago to enter into an agreement with the district cooling system now known as Thermal Chicago, thus contributing to the national effort to reduce the discharge of ozone-damaging CFCs.  In 2006, MMPI joined Clean Air Counts, a voluntary initiative to reduce smog forming pollutants and energy consumption in the Chicago area. Part of the campaign strategies included utilizing only low VOC cleaning products, paints and building materials, as well as energy efficient lighting and alternative workplace transportation options. To date, the Mart Center has reduced pollution by 264,018 pounds (119,757 kg), the largest reduction by a commercial building.  That same year, the Mart Center recycling program saved over 13,000 trees and recycled nearly 11 million pounds of waste, while water conservation efforts saved 5.5 million US gallons (21,000 m3) of water. More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200. In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent post-consumer recycled product.  The Mart has nine LEED-certified showrooms, with five others on their way to LEED certification.

Passage:Rohrbach was first mentioned in 795 as Roorbah when a local noble, Heribold, gave his lands in Madiswil to the church in Rohrbach. In the 9th century some land around the village was given to the Abbey of St. Gall. The Abbey established an administrator in Rohrbach to manage their lands in the Oberaargau region. Since the Abbey was an Imperial Abbey, the administrator and the landholders on the Abbey's land had immunity from the local count's court and could only be arrested or tried by the Abbey court. At the beginning of the 14th century the bailiwick and the low court of the local Barons of Ruti. Between 1314 and 1370 both offices were held by the Count of Signau and after 1371 by the Count of Grünenberg. The Grünenberg Counts incorporated the village into their personal territory. Hermann of Eptingen then acquired the rule over the village by marriage. He supported the Austrian Habsburgs in the Old Zürich War (1440–46) and lost the village to a Bernese army. After the war, the village was returned to his wife in 1449. In 1504 Bern bought the entire village from Hermann's decedents. In 1505 the village was incorporated into the bailiwick of Wangen. However, Rohrbach retained several special privileges. They were exempt from forced labor for the bailiff and in wars they marched under the banner of the city of Bern. After the 1798 French invasion it was part of the District of Langenthal in the Helvetic Republic and in 1803 it went to the District of Aarwangen.  Links: a. Aarwangen b. Abbey of Saint Gall c.

{"question": "Many Seychelles warblers of breeding age forgo breeding, remaining instead with their parents and helping to raise their own siblings. This behavior, called cooperative breeding, results from the scarcity of nesting territory for the birds on the tiny island that, until recently, was home to the world' s population of Seychelles warblers. Yet when healthy warblers were transplanted to a much larger neighboring island as part of an experiment, most of those warblers maintained a pattern of cooperative breeding. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the result of the experiment? A: Most of the terrain on the neighboring island was not of the type in which Seychelles warblers generally build their nests. B: Cooperative breeding in species other than the Seychelles warbler often results when the environment cannot sustain a rise in the population. C: The climate of the island to which Seychelles warblers were transplanted was the same as that of the warblers' native island.

{"question": "Title: Good Charlotte Background: Good Charlotte is an American rock band from Waldorf, Maryland, that formed in 1996. Since 1998, the band's constant members have been vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist and vocalist Benji Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin, while drummer Dean Butterworth has been a member of the band since 2005. After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band has released six studio albums: Good Charlotte (2000), The Young and the Hopeless (2002), The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004), Good Morning Revival (2007), Cardiology (2010) and Youth Authority (2016), as well as two compilations: Greatest Remixes (2008) and Greatest Hits (2010). Section: The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004-07) Passage: Good Charlotte's third album, The Chronicles of Life and Death, was released by Epic Records in 2004. The album received mixed reactions from both the music press and Good Charlotte's fan base. The album sold 2.2 million copies. The album has been widely considered a departure from the band's previous two albums, mixing new elements such as lyrical topics into Good Charlotte's youthful sound. Singles released from the album include the two hits \"Predictable\" and \"I Just Wanna Live\", as well as \"The Chronicles of Life and Death\" and \"We Believe\". The only single from The Chronicles of Life and Death which managed to chart on the U.S. Hot 100 was the hit \"I Just Wanna Live\". All of the singles released from the album went top 30 in the UK, except for \"We Believe\". The band would then go on tour with Sum 41.  In May 2005, after much speculation from fans, it was officially confirmed that Chris Wilson had left the band citing personal health reasons. Benji also told Kerrang! magazine that, for him, \"Chris leaving the band was the worst part of 2005.\" Chris then joined the pop/punk band The Summer Obsession until 2011. He currently plays drums for JMSN.  On Good Charlotte's \"Noise to the World\" Tour, performing with Simple Plan and Relient K, the band recruited Dean Butterworth (who had previously played for Morrissey) as the band's temporary drummer. Later, in March 2007, Butterworth was confirmed as the band's permanent drummer.

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanismswhich include resistance, persistence and tolerancewe propose defiance as a subclass of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. Using locked antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that are activated by bacterial 5 proteases as a prototypic prodrug, we observe that although treatment eliminates bacteria across the vast majority of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, concentration of growth nutrients), bacteria spontaneously switch from susceptibility to defiance under conditions that alter the competing rates between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation. To identify the determinants of this switch-like behavior, we model bacteria-prodrug dynamics as a multi-rate 10 feedback system and identify a dimensionless quantity we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that perfectly classifies bacteria as either defiant or susceptible across a broad range of treatment conditions. By recognizing that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance behaves analogously to electronic transistors, we construct prodrug logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to allow assembly of an integrated 3-bit multi-prodrug circuit that kills defiant bacteria 15 under all possible combinations of BAH values (i.e., 000, 001, …, 111) that represent a broad range of possible treatment conditions. Our study identifies a form of bacterial resistance specific to prodrugs that is described by a predictive dimensionless constant to reveal logic-based treatment strategies using multi-prodrug biological circuits.", "answer": "Prodrug defiance reveals logic-based strategies for treating bacterial resistance"}

{"question": "In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.   Passage: Briarcliff Manor's original settlement was known as Whitson's Corners for brothers John H., Richard, and Reuben Whitson, who owned adjoining farms in the area totaling 400 acres (160 ha). Whitson's Corners was named after the corner of Pleasantville and South State Roads, where John H. Whitson's house, the Crossways, stood from 1820 until the 1940s. The Briarcliff Congregational Church's parish house currently stands at its former location. The neighboring community of Scarborough was known as Weskora until it was renamed in 1864, after resident William Kemey's ancestral hometown in Yorkshire. After the community was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad put up a sign reading \"Briarcliff West\" at the village's Scarborough station. Soon afterward, attributed to the neighborhood's pride over their name, that sign was thrown into the Hudson River and replaced with the original Scarborough sign.Briarcliff Manor derives from \"Brier Cliff\", a compound of the English words \"brier\" and \"cliff\". The name originated in Ireland as that of the family home of John David Ogilby, a professor of ecclesiastical history at the General Theological Seminary. Ogilby had named his New York summer home Brier Cliff after his family home in Ireland. In 1890, Walter Law bought James Stillman's 236-acre (96 ha) Briarcliff Farm and further developed it, later using the name Briarcliff for all his property. Law's friend, Andrew Carnegie, called him \"The Laird of Briarcliff Manor\"; since the title appealed to all concerned, the village was named \"Briarcliff Manor\". By 1897, the village post office and railroad station bore the name Briarcliff Manor. The village (and its name) were approved by its residents in a September 12, 1902 referendum; the name prevailed over other suggestions, including \"Sing Sing East\". On November 21, 1902, the village of Briarcliff Manor was established.The village is also known by several other names. It is conversationally called \"Briarcliff\", and often erroneously written as \"Briar Cliff Manor\" (although historically there has been little distinction). The village has been called \"Briarcliff on the Hudson\" by Mark Twain and Aileen Riggin; it is also known as \"the Village of Briarcliff Manor\". The name Briarcliff has also been applied to other municipalities, including the 470-person town of Briarcliffe Acres in South Carolina; in naming it, the town's founder had drawn inspiration from Briarcliff Manor's name.  Question: What was the name of the town Scarborough was named after?", "answer": "Yorkshire."}

The story provided several estimates for the cost of gastric banding; it also discussed insurance coverage, i.e. that the procedure was not always covered by insurance. While the story mentioned weight loss, health improvement, and longer life, it failed to provide quantitative estimates for these. The story provided quantitative information on the disease reduction obtained with the use of this device in individuals with type II diabetes. Although the story did mention that weight loss is slower with gastric banding than with gastric bypass, it failed to provide quantitative information about the amount or rate of weight loss attained with banding. The story should also have mentioned that long-term followup finds for those whose diabetes resolves following gastric banding, about half re-develop diabetes at 10 years. The story mentioned weight regain as well as some of the side effects that occur with the use of this device. For a more complete discussion, it should have included information about how frequently these occur. When discussing the effect of gastric banding on type II diabetes, the story mentioned the research about the use of this device for this population. It mentioned the evidence about safety and effectiveness and where it had been published. As for the impact of the banding procedure on weight, the story neglected to include information on the average weight loss seen but did include several patient anecdotes. However the story was more focused on the marketing strategies for this device rather than the health claims per se. The story did not engage in disease mongering.

{"question": "Title: Pete Pihos Background: Pihos was born in 1923 in Orlando, Florida. His parents, Louis and Mary Pihos, were Greek immigrants. In August 1937, when Pihos was 13 years old, his father, the operator of an all-night restaurant in Orlando, was murdered. His body was discovered behind the counter of the restaurant with his skull fractured in 12 places. Section: 1945 and 1946 seasons Passage: When Pihos returned to Indiana after his military service, he played at the fullback position for the 1945 Indiana Hoosiers football team that compiled the only undefeated record (9-0-1) in Indiana football history, won the program's first Big Ten Conference championship, and finished the season ranked No. 4 in the final AP Poll. He had only two days of practice before his first game back, Indiana's second game of the season, against Northwestern. He scored Indiana's only touchdown in the game, when he caught a pass at the Northwestern five-yard line and dragged three defenders with him over the goal-line. He scored the first two touchdowns in Indiana's 26-0 win over Purdue in the final game of the year. Pihos finished the season having carried the ball 92 times for 410 yards and seven touchdowns. He earned first-team All-America honors from Yank, the Army Weekly magazine, and finished eighth in voting for the Heisman Trophy.  As a senior, Pihos played three positions (fullback, halfback, and quarterback) and was named the most valuable player on the 1946 Indiana Hoosiers football team. In a show of versatility, and despite suffering from a throat infection and thigh injury during the 1946 season, he carried the ball 76 times for 262 rushing yards, completed seven of twelve passes for 84 passing yards, had ten catches for 213 receiving yards, and scored eight touchdowns. He ended his college career by scoring three touchdowns against the Purdue Boilermakers, helping the Hoosiers win the Old Oaken Bucket for that year. Pihos finished third in the voting for the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the most valuable player in the Big Nine Conference.  In four seasons at Indiana, Pihos scored 138 points, which was then the school's all-time scoring record. He also broke Indiana career records for touchdowns and receptions. Bo McMillin, Indiana's head football coach since 1934, called Pihos \"the greatest all-around football player our team has known in my time at Indiana.\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: Who did Pihos play for during the 45-46 season?

{"question": "Title: Columbus Delano Background: Columbus Delano, (June 4, 1809 - October 23, 1896) was a lawyer, rancher, banker, statesman and a member of the prominent Delano family. Delano was elected U.S. Congressman from Ohio, serving two full terms and one partial one. Prior to the American Civil War, Delano was a National Republican and then a Whig; as a Whig he was identified with the faction of the party that opposed the spread of slavery into the Western territories, and he became a Republican when the party was founded as the major anti-slavery party after the demise of the Whigs in the 1850s. During Reconstruction Delano advocated federal protection of African-Americans civil rights, and argued that the former Confederate states should be administered by the federal government, but were not part of the United States until they met the requirements for readmission to the Union. Section: Resignation and corruption (1875) Passage: In 1875, Delano's reputation for personal honesty came under increasing scrutiny as revelations of corruption in the Grant administration continued to be the subject of investigations and media revelations. Westerners unhappy with Delano's rulings on land grants and other issues accused Delano's son John, an employee of the Interior Department, of corruption, bribery, and fraud. Governor Edward M. McCook of the Colorado Territory, claimed that John Delano had accepted a $1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, to secure land patents from the Department of Interior.  The New-York Tribune reported that John Delano was profiteering through Interior's Office of the Surveyor General by accepting partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts without having been trained in surveying or map making, and without providing any meaningful contribution to the fulfillment of the contracts; the obvious implication was John Delano had taken extortion money from illicit contract agreements. In March 1875, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor's Office, L. C. Stevens, wrote to Benjamin Bristow, Grant's Secretary of the Treasury, stating that Surveyor General Silas Reed had made several corrupt contracts which financially benefited John Delano. Stevens also said both Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for $5,000. More damaging was Stevens' charge that Columbus Delano knew and approved of what Reed had done for John Delano.  Both Bristow and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish demanded that Grant fire Delano. Grant declined, telling Fish, \"If Delano were now to resign, it would be retreating under fire and be accepted as an admission of the charges.\" The controversy did not abate; by mid-August it became clear that Delano could not remain in office; Delano offered his resignation and Grant accepted, but Grant did not make it public. Grant finally announced his acceptance of Delano's resignation on October 19, 1875, after Bristow threatened to resign if Delano was not replaced. Grant replaced Delano with Zachariah Chandler, who quickly initiated civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. Delano's administration was investigated by Congress, Chandler, and a special presidential commission; his personal conduct was exonerated, but his reputation as an honest, capable administrator was damaged, and Delano never again ran for office or served in an appointed one. In April 1876, The Committee on the Expeditures in the Interior Department confirmed that Reed had set up an illicit slush fund for John Delano's financial benefit, and that Delano thanked Reed while also telling him \"to be careful to do nothing that would have the semblance of wrong.\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: Why did he resign? Answer: corruption, bribery, and fraud. Question: What was corrupt about it? Answer: blackmailed five deputy surveyors for $5,000. Question: In what other ways was he corrupt? Answer: accepted a $1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, to secure land patents from the Department of Interior. Question: Was he caught doing this? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Was he forced to resign or did he do it on his own free will?

{"question": "Title: Etruscan civilization Background: The Etruscan civilization () is the modern name given to a powerful and wealthy civilization of ancient Italy in the area corresponding roughly to Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Lazio. As distinguished by its unique language, this civilization endured from before the time of the earliest Etruscan inscriptions (c. 700 BC) until its assimilation into the Roman Republic, beginning in the late 4th century BC with the Roman-Etruscan Wars. Culture that is identifiably Etruscan developed in Italy after about 800 BC, approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture. The latter gave way in the 7th century BC to a culture that was influenced by Ancient Greek culture. Section: Expansion Passage: Etruscan expansion was focused both to the north beyond the Apennine Mountains and into Campania. Some small towns in the sixth century BC disappeared during this time, ostensibly consumed by greater, more powerful neighbours. However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, Magna Graecia in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast of Sardinia, Spain and Corsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with Carthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks.  Around 540 BC, the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. From the first half of the 5th century BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480 BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474, Syracuse's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and Samnites.  In the 4th century BC, Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century BC. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did the Etruscans expand? Answer: Etruscan expansion was focused both to the north beyond the Apennine Mountains and into Campania. Some small towns in the sixth century BC disappeared during this time, Question: What was the outcome of this focus? Answer: The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula Question: how did this mining proceed as they expanded? Answer: Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast Question: How did the Greeks respond to their expansion?

One year later, Allen conveyed the property to Brenda by general warranty deed. The deed did not mention the lien, but Brenda was aware of it. Two years later, Brenda conveyed Birchacre to Carla by special warranty deed. Carla was not aware of the lien and her deed also made no mention of it.

{"question": "Title: Romani people Background: The Romani (also spelled Romany , ), or Roma, are a traditionally itinerant ethnic group, living mostly in Europe and the Americas and originating from the northern Indian subcontinent, from the Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Sindh regions of modern-day India and Pakistan. A DNA study conducted by Indian and Estonian research facilities shows that the Roma/Romani/Gypsy and Sinti people originate from the so-called \"Untouchable\" Dalit community from India. The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity. They are a dispersed people, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). Section: Other designations Passage: The English term Gypsy (or Gipsy) originates from the Middle English gypcian, short for Egipcien. The Spanish term Gitano and French Gitan have similar etymologies. They are ultimately derived from the Greek Aiguptioi (Aigyptioi), meaning Egyptian, via Latin. This designation owes its existence to the belief, common in the Middle Ages, that the Romani, or some related group (such as the Middle Eastern Dom people), were itinerant Egyptians. According to one narrative they were exiled from Egypt as punishment for allegedly harbouring the infant Jesus. As described in Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the medieval French referred to the Romanies as Egyptiens. The word Gypsy in English has become so pervasive that many Romani organizations use it in their own organizational names.  This exonym is sometimes written with capital letter, to show that it designates an ethnic group. However, the word is sometimes considered derogatory because of its negative and stereotypical associations. The Council of Europe consider that 'Gypsy' or equivalent terms, as well as administrative terms such as 'Gens du Voyage' (referring in fact to an ethnic group but not acknowledging ethnic identification) are not in line with European recommendations. In North America, the word Gypsy is most commonly used as a reference to Romani ethnicity, though lifestyle and fashion are at times also referenced by using this word.  Another common designation of the Romani people is Cingane (alt. Tsinganoi, Zigar, Zigeuner), which likely derives from Athinganoi, the name of a Christian sect with whom the Romani (or some related group) became associated in the Middle Ages. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What is another designation of the Romani people? Answer: The English term Gypsy (or Gipsy) originates from the Middle English gypcian, short for Egipcien. Question: Who refer to them as gypsy? Answer: They are ultimately derived from the Greek Aiguptioi (Aigyptioi), meaning Egyptian, via Latin. Question: What other names do they have?

{"question": "Title: Tropic Thunder Background: Tropic Thunder is a 2008 black satirical action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller, who stars with Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors who are making a fictional Vietnam War film. When their frustrated director drops them in the middle of a jungle, they are forced to rely on their acting skills to survive the real action and danger. The screenplay by Justin Theroux, Stiller, and Etan Cohen was from a story by Stiller and Theroux. The film was produced by Stuart Cornfeld, Stiller and Eric McLeod for Red Hour Productions and DreamWorks Pictures as an international co-production between the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Section: Promotion Passage: A trailer for the film was released in April 2008.

DreamWorks also released a red band trailer, the first of its kind used by the studio to promote one of its films.  Stiller, Downey, and Black appeared on the seventh-season finale of American Idol in a sketch as The Pips performing with Gladys Knight (via archival footage). The three actors also later performed a sketch at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards which featured the actors attempting to create a successful viral video to promote the film with awkward results.

The screening was on behalf of the United Service Organizations and included the actors heading to the screening by helicopter and Humvees. On August 8, 2008, a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story aired about the making of Tropic Thunder. In video games, a themed scavenger hunt was incorporated into Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and Stiller allowed his likeness to be used in the online Facebook application game based on the film.  As a tie-in for the film's release, Paramount announced it would market the energy drink known in the film as \"Booty Sweat\". Michael Corcoran, Paramount's president of consumer products, commented on the release: \"We're very excited, because it has the potential to live for quite a while, well beyond the film.\" The drink was sold in college bookstores, on Amazon.com, and at other retailers.

A lot of people shared my feelings. Claudius wanted to have a big army. He expected men to volunteer to join. Many men just did not want to fight in wars. They did not want to leave their wives and families. As you might have guessed, not many men signed up. This made Claudius furious. So what happened? He had a crazy idea. He thought that if men were not married, they would not mind joining the army. So Claudius decided not to allow any more marriages. Young people thought his new law was cruel. I thought it was preposterous! I certainly wasn't going to support that law! Did I mention that I was a priest  ? One of my favourite activities was to marry couples. Even after Emperor Claudius passed his law, I kept  on  performing  marriage  ceremonies -- secretly, of course. It was really quite exciting. Imagine a small candlelit room with only the bride and groom and myself. We would whisper the words of the ceremony, listening all the while for the steps of soldiers. One night, we did hear footsteps. It was scary! Thank goodness the couple I was marrying escaped in time. I was caught. I was thrown in jail and told that my punishment was death. I tried to stay cheerful. And do you know what? Wonderful things happened. Many young people came to the jail to visit me. They threw flowers and notes up to my window. They wanted me to know that they, too, believed in love. On the day I was to die, February 14, 269 A.D.

{"question": "Title: Wes Hall Background: Sir Wesley Winfield Hall (born 12 September 1937) is a Barbadian former cricketer and politician. A tall, strong and powerfully built man, Hall was a genuine fast bowler and despite his very long run up, he was renowned for his ability to bowl long spells. Hall played 48 Test matches for the West Indies from 1958 to 1969. Hall's opening bowling partnership with fellow Barbadian Charlie Griffith was a feature of the strong West Indies teams throughout the 1960s. Section: Style and personality Passage: Hall had a magnificent, bounding approach, eyes bulging, teeth glinting, crucifix flying, climaxing in a classical cartwheel action and intimidating followthrough.  Hall was a tall and muscular cricketer, 6 feet 5 inches (196 cm) tall and bearing the \"physique and strength of a bodybuilder.\" He had a graceful, classical action and one of the longest run-ups in Test cricket. A genuinely fast bowler, he was timed at 91 miles per hour (146 km/h). Hall was able to sustain pace and hostility for very long spells--during the Test against England at Lord's in 1963 he bowled unchanged for over three hours on the final day. While Hall was an aggressive fast bowler, he was not one to set out to injure the batsman. The England cricketer Ted Dexter--himself hit several times by Hall--said \"there was never a hint of malice in [Hall] or in his bowling\". Hall himself said after one of his deliveries fractured Australian cricketer Wally Grout's jaw \"It made me sick to see Wal leaving and it made me sicker to hear some jokers in the crowd ranting on as though I had intentionally hurt [Grout]\".  While Hall could never be described as an all-rounder, on occasions he was an effective batsman. His one century in first-class cricket was against Cambridge University Cricket Club at Fenners--scored in 65 minutes, the fastest century of the 1963 English season. Wisden said of this innings, \"[Hall's] batting promised so much ... [he] made his runs in the classic mould, not in the unorthodox manner usually adopted by fast bowlers.\" With his characteristic humour, Hall said of this innings, \"Ah, but it wasn't any old hundred, it was against the intelligentsia.\"  Hall was one of the most popular cricketers of his day. The Australian commentator Johnnie Moyes described Hall as \"a rare box-office attraction, a man who caught and held the affections of the paying public.\" Hall was particularly popular in Australia. When invited back to play for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield in 1961-62, Hall arrived in Brisbane to \"scenes more in keeping with the arrival of a pop star, a thousand people jamming the old terminal building at Eagle Farm airport to welcome him.\" Hall was fond of a bet and was a keen follower of horseracing. Hall is known as a good humoured man; C. L. R. James observed \"Hall simply exudes good nature at every pore.\" Tony Cozier states \"[Hall] is renowned for his entertaining, if prolonged oratory, as well as for his tardiness.\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: What sort of style did he have? Answer: Hall had a magnificent, bounding approach, eyes bulging, teeth glinting, crucifix flying, climaxing in a classical cartwheel action and intimidating followthrough. Question: Did this style develop over time? Answer: While Hall could never be described as an all-rounder, Question: What was his personality like?

{"question": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question. Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on the article.   Article: Sadness is unpleasant, and in a society where personal happiness is prized above all else, there is little tolerance for falling in despair. Especially now we've got drugs for getting rid of sad feelings -- whether it's after losing a job, the break-up of a relationship or the death of a loved one. So it's no surprise that more and more people are taking them. But is  _ really such a good idea? A growing number of voices from the world of mental health research are saying it isn't. They fear that the increasing tendency to treat normal sadness as a disease is playing fast and loose  . Sadness, they argue, serves a useful purpose--and if we lose it, we lose out. Yet many psychiatrists   insist not. Sadness has a nasty habit of turning into depression , they warn. Even when people are sad for good reason, they should take drugs to make themselves feel better. So who is right? Is sadness something we cannot live without or something horrible never to touch?  There are lots of ideas about why feeling sad should become part of human life. It may be a self-protection strategy, as other primates   also show signs of sadness. A losing monkey that doesn't show sadness after it loses a fight may be seen as continuing to challenge the winning monkey -- and that could result in death. In humans sadness has a further function: we may display sadness as a form of communication. By acting sad, we tell other community members that we need support. Then there is the idea that creativity is connected to dark moods. There are plenty of great artists, writers and musicians who have suffered from depression or disorder. Scientists found that people with signs of depression performed better at a creative task, and negative moods make people think deeply over the unhappy experience, which allows creative processes to come to the front. There is also evidence that too much happiness can be bad for your career. A doctor found that people who scored 8 out of 10 on a happiness test were more successful in income and education than 9s or 10s. The happiest people lose their willingness to make changes to their lives that may benefit them.   Question: The author believes sadness is   _  .

By Katie RazzallUK editor, BBC Newsnight Taxi driver Ashgar Bostan was jailed in 2018 after being convicted of two counts of rape. Elizabeth - not her real name - said moving her attacker to an open prison had left her \"absolutely petrified\". The Ministry of Justice has apologised and said it was investigating the matter. Bostan was jailed for nine years after being convicted of raping Elizabeth twice at a flat in Rotherham, when she was about 14 or 15 years old. She contacted BBC Newsnight after the Ministry of Justice's Victim Liaison Unit (VLU) called her to say Bostan had been moved to a Category D prison, where offenders are eligible for outside work and home visits, subject to risk assessments. It is a requirement that victims are informed when a key stage of an offender's sentence is being considered to give them the opportunity to comment and contribute to any conditions set. 'Petrified of him' Elizabeth told the programme she had been \"failed as a child\" and was being \"failed again\" years later. \"The only difference is now I'm actually an adult and I understand what's going off,\" she said. \"How can you get a sentence for raping children and then be classed as a Cat D? I just don't understand. \"My main fear is that he is going to come out and do it to somebody else. My other fear is that I'm not going to be safe. I am petrified of him.\" In correspondence with Elizabeth seen by BBC Newsnight, a victim liaison officer acknowledged it was \"very difficult news to receive\", apologised for failing to tell her and said \"the Victim Liaison Unit was not able to notify you prior to the move as we were not informed\". It said investigations into this failure were taking place and further apologised for the \"great deal of distress\". Rotherham Labour MP Sarah Champion has written to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to ask if the decision will be reconsidered. She wrote: \"Given the severity of the offences involved, and that the perpetrator is only two-and-a-half years into a nine-year sentence, I do not believe that transfer to an open prison is in any way appropriate. \"Of particular concern to my constituent is the chance that the abuser may also be allowed visits home which could put her at further risk.\" A Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We sincerely apologise for the distress caused and have taken immediate action to prevent it happening again. \"Offenders in category D prisons are not automatically eligible for temporary release, this is subject to a tough risk assessment and victims have the right to request restrictions such as exclusion zones.\" You can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:45 BST.

{"question": "Title: Stephen Larkham Background: Stephen Larkham (born 29 May 1974 in Canberra) is a retired Australian rugby union footballer currently in the role of attack coach for the Australian Rugby Union side, the Wallabies. He is best known for his career with the Brumbies in Super Rugby, for whom he played from the inception of the professional Super 12 in 1996 through 2007, and his long tenure with the Wallabies at international level, for whom he played 102 times. After initial selection at fullback from 1996 to 1997, Larkham was the first-choice Australian fly-half from 1997 to 2007, playing in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups. He is married to Jacqueline and has two children, Jaimee and Tiahna. Section: 1999 Rugby World Cup drop-goal Passage: Larkham's famous 48m-drop goal to seal victory over South Africa in extra time of the 1999 Rugby World Cup Semi-Final has gone down in rugby folklore as the defining moment in the Wallabies' victorious Rugby World Cup campaign. South Africa had got to the semi final largely through the efforts of Jannie de Beer kicking 5 drop goals in their previous match. By contrast not one of the Australian players on the team had to that date ever scored a drop goal at test level. The fact that Larkham had quite a badly injured knee through the match caused Steve Smith to remark incredulously while calling the game for English ITV \"He can barely stand on that leg and yet he just thwacked it over.\"  The feat was even more remarkable as Larkham's eyesight was very poor at the time. Since 1999 he has had laser surgery to correct his vision, however at the time he could not see the goal posts clearly. Following Australia's victory over France in the World Cup final, several television commercials aired in Australia humorously mocking Larkham's lack of kicking prowess. The commercial featured current & former teammates, junior and senior coaches (including former Australian coach Rod MacQueen) and even Australian rugby icons (such as Phil Kearns) expressing their astonishment that Larkham managed to score.  The commercial begins with Larkham's school coaches saying he was a poor kicker, and had never successfully scored a drop-goal in a match. The climax of the commercial features then-captain John Eales, as well as Matt Burke, Kearns and MacQueen each saying \"Don't kick it!\" as footage of the moment is replayed. The commercial is available to view on YouTube. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What team won the 1999 Rugby World Cup drop-goal? Answer: the Wallabies Question: How many drop goals were there?

{"question": "Title: Indigenous peoples of Mexico Background: Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indigenas de Mexico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population. Section: Languages Passage: The Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Languages recognizes 62 indigenous languages as \"national languages\" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken. According to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI), approximately 6.7% of the population speaks an indigenous language. That is, less than half of those identified as indigenous. 6,695,228 people 5 years or older were tallied as indigenous-language speakers in the 2010 census, an increase of about 650,000 from the 2000 census. In 2000, 6,044,547 people 5 years or older spoke an indigenous language.  In previous censuses, information on the indigenous speaking population five years of age and older was obtained from the Mexican people. However, in the 2010 census, this approach was changed and the Government also began to collect data on people 3 years and older because from the age of 3, children are able to communicate verbally. With this new approach, it was determined that there were 6,913,362 people 3 years of age or more who spoke an indigenous language (218,000 children 3 and 4 four years of age fell into this category), accounting for 6.6% of the total population. The population of children aged 0 to 2 years in homes where the head of household or a spouse spoke an indigenous language was 678 954. The indigenous language speaking population has been increasing in absolute numbers for decades, but have nonetheless been falling in proportion to the national population.  The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the 1980s. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What languages are/were spoken by the Indigenous people of mexico? Answer: 62 indigenous languages as \"national languages\" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken. Question: What is the most popular (or a few of the most spoken) language(s) from these 62 ? Answer: which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken. Question: Are there different culturally different people residing in different territories ? Answer: recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, Question: What is significant or unique about the ethnic groups and or their culture ?

{"question": "Title: Casey Stengel Background: Charles Dillon Stengel was born on July 30, 1890, in Kansas City, Missouri. His ancestry involves German and Irish; his parents--Louis Stengel and Jennie (Wolff) Stengel--were from the Quad Cities area of Illinois and Iowa, and had moved to Kansas City soon after their 1886 wedding so Louis could take an insurance job. \"Charlie\" was the youngest of three children, and the second son. Charlie Stengel played sandlot baseball as a child, and also played baseball, football and basketball at Kansas City's Central High School. Section: Minor leagues Passage: Before reporting to spring training for the Blues in early 1910 at Excelsior Springs, Missouri, Stengel was approached by his neighbor, Kid Nichols, a former star pitcher, who advised him to listen to his manager and to the older players, and if he was minded to reject their advice, at least think it over for a month or so first. Stengel failed to make the ball club, which was part of the American Association, considered one of the top minor leagues.  Kansas City optioned Stengel to the Kankakee Kays of the Class D Northern Association, a lower-level minor league, to gain experience as an outfielder. He had a .251 batting average with Kankakee when the league folded in July. He found a place with the Shelbyville Grays, who moved mid-season and became the Maysville Rivermen, of the Class D Blue Grass League, batting .221. He returned to the Blues for the final week of the season, with his combined batting average for 1910 at .237.  Uncertain of whether he would be successful as a baseball player, Stengel attended Western Dental College in the 1910-1911 offseason. He would later tell stories of his woes as a left-handed would-be dentist using right-handed equipment. The Blues sold Stengel to the Aurora Blues of the Class C Wisconsin-Illinois League. He led the league with a .352 batting average. Brooklyn Dodgers scout Larry Sutton took a trip from Chicago to nearby Aurora, noticed Stengel, and the Dodgers purchased his contract on September 1, 1911. Brooklyn outfielder Zach Wheat later claimed credit for tipping off Sutton that Stengel was worth signing. Stengel finished the season with Aurora and returned to dental school for the offseason.  The Dodgers assigned Stengel to the Montgomery Rebels of the Class A Southern Association for the 1912 season. Playing for manager Kid Elberfeld, Stengel batted .290 and led the league in outfield assists. He also developed a reputation as an eccentric player. Scout Mike Kahoe referred to Stengel as a \"dandy ballplayer, but it's all from the neck down\". After reporting to Brooklyn in September and getting a taste of the big leagues, he spent a third offseason at dental school in 1912-1913. He did not graduate, though whenever his baseball career hit a bad patch in the years to follow, his wife Edna would urge him to get his degree.

Earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition metal–based catalysts have been developed for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER); however, they operate at overpotentials substantially above thermodynamic requirements. Density functional theory suggested that non-3d high-valency metals such as tungsten can modulate 3d metal oxides, providing near-optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates. We developed a room-temperature synthesis to produce gelled oxyhydroxides materials with an atomically homogeneous metal distribution. These gelled FeCoW oxyhydroxides exhibit the lowest overpotential (191 millivolts) reported at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst shows no evidence of degradation after more than 500 hours of operation. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a synergistic interplay between tungsten, iron, and cobalt in producing a favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure that enhance the energetics for OER.", "answer": "Homogeneously dispersed multimetal oxygen-evolving catalysts"}

{"question": "In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.   Most generative models of audio directly generate samples in one of two domains: time or frequency. While sufficient to express any signal, these representations are inefficient, as they do not utilize existing knowledge of how sound is generated and perceived. A third approach (vocoders/synthesizers) successfully incorporates strong domain knowledge of signal processing and perception, but has been less actively researched due to limited expressivity and difficulty integrating with modern auto-differentiation-based machine learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which enables direct integration of classic signal processing elements with deep learning methods. Focusing on audio synthesis, we achieve high-fidelity generation without the need for large autoregressive models or adversarial losses, demonstrating that DDSP enables utilizing strong inductive biases without losing the expressive power of neural networks. Further, we show that combining interpretable modules permits manipulation of each separate model component, with applications such as independent control of pitch and loudness, realistic extrapolation to pitches not seen during training, blind dereverberation of room acoustics, transfer of extracted room acoustics to new environments, and transformation of timbre between disparate sources. In short, DDSP enables an interpretable and modular approach to generative modeling, without sacrificing the benefits of deep learning. The library will is available at https://github.com/magenta/ddsp and we encourage further contributions from the community and domain experts.", "answer": "Better audio synthesis by combining interpretable DSP with end-to-end learning."}

It said it was Russia's response to Mr Poroshenko's decree banning some of Russia's biggest social media networks and net services popular in Ukraine. Kiev provided no evidence of Russia's involvement in the attack. There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities on the Ukrainian accusation. The Ukrainian presidential administration said the situation was \"under control\", and there was \"no threat to the work of the website\". Several hours after the administration's statement the website was working normally, with all links on the main page being accessible. Ukraine's decision earlier on Tuesday to impose the ban on Russian sites is a significant ramping up of sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and alleged involvement in the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine. Those targeted include social networks VK.com and Odnoklassniki, search engine Yandex and the Mail.ru email service. Ukrainian service providers have been ordered to block access to the sites. The companies' offices in Ukraine will also face asset freezes and other restrictions although it was not immediately clear how the ban on the services would come into force and whether Ukraine had the technical means to enforce it. The president's decision to push through a decision by Ukraine's national security council could prove controversial domestically, as VK (VKontakte) alone has up to 14 million users in Ukraine and Odnoklassniki (which translates as Classmates) is also widely popular.

{"question": "In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.   Passage: During the late 12th century, about 100 years after the Norman conquest (1066), the Normans have removed the native ruling class, replacing it with a new monarchy, aristocracy and clerical hierarchy. Thomas Becket is a Saxon protégé and facilitator to the carousing King Henry II, who transforms into a man who continually invokes the \"honour of God\". Henry appoints Becket Lord Chancellor to have a close confidant in this position whom he can completely control. Instead, Becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. Henry finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive, and is described as the \"perennial adolescent\" by the Bishop of London. Henry is more interested in escaping his duties through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. He is increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry's court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry's Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as the queen and Henry's mother, who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage. Henry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property to support Henry's military campaigns in France (\"Bishop, I must hire the Swiss Guards to fight for me – and no one has ever paid them off with principles!\"). During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives word that the old archbishop has \"gone to God's bosom\". In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice.  Question: What is the full name of the person who is in a stale arranged marriage?", "answer": "King Henry II."}

{"question": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words.   Scotland's first minister called Brexit a \"horror show\", saying she was seeking the \"least damaging\" outcome inside the single market. Theresa May is said to be considering appointing a minister for a no deal Brexit in a reshuffle of her cabinet. But Ms Sturgeon said this approach \"beggars belief\", saying Ms May was \"appeasing hard-line Brexiteers\". The Scottish and UK governments have been locked in dispute over the UK's exit from the EU, with Scottish ministers refusing to put forward Westminster Brexit legislation for consent votes at Holyrood until a deal is struck over powers returning from Brussels. Newspaper reports have speculated that the prime minister is set to appoint a junior minister to examine the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, as a move to demonstrate to EU leaders that she is serious about this as an option if talks fail. Ms Sturgeon told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme she had read the reports \"in disbelief\" and \"despair\", saying: \"It beggars belief. It seems to give the impression that the UK government think this is some sort of game, that Theresa May is more concerned with appeasing the hard-line Tory Brexiteers than she is about acting in the best interests of the country.\" \"No deal is unthinkable. Let me be absolutely clear, no Brexit is preferable to no deal.\" The Scottish government is to set out papers later in January analysing the different possible outcomes of Brexit for Scotland's economy, including single market membership, a free trade agreement with the EU or no deal. Ms Sturgeon said: \"There's no doubt at all that staying within the single market, staying with the customs union is not the best outcome - staying in the EU in my view is the best outcome - but it's the least damaging outcome. \"I think 2018 has to be the year where we see jobs, the economy, the protections that come from EU membership like workers rights, consumers rights, really come to the fore, and the Tory Brexiteers sidelined rather than given greater precedence.\" Ms Sturgeon said she would \"make an assessment and come to a judgement\" about a possible Scottish independence referendum \"once we see the outcome\" of the next stage of Brexit negotiations. On the prospect of a second EU vote, she said this was \"not the position of the SNP, it's not a policy we're campaigning for\", but added that \"as the situation develops, the argument for giving people a say on the final outcome may become irresistible\". She said: \"This is where the EU referendum in 2016 was very very different to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. In 2016 there was no detail about what the future relationship between the UK and the EU would be if there was a vote for Brexit, and we go into 2018 and we still don't have any detail about that. \"If we did get into a position for example where there was no deal, I'm very clear and I think a lot of people - certainly in Scotland but I suspect across the UK as a whole - would think that in those circumstances, no Brexit was absolutely preferable to a no-deal situation, which would be devastating for so many aspects of our economy and society.\" Mrs May has insisted that she wants to have a deal in place by the time the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been a \"a real spirit of cooperation\" between negotiators from the UK and the EU, seeking \"a deal that is in everybody's best interests\". She said: \"What we want is our own free trade agreement with the European Union. It would be a free trade agreement to cover both goods and services, and what I want to do is to ensure that as we look at the Brexit deal going forward it's important we recognise why people voted to leave the European Union here in the UK. \"Some of that was about free movement, and an end to free movement. Some of it actually was about the issue of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and people wanting control, but at the same time I think people still want to have a good economic relationship with the EU so we want as frictionless and tariff-free a trading relationship with the EU as possible \"That's what we mean when we talk about having a free trade agreement which isn't modelled on somebody else's agreement, but is actually the right one for the UK.\"", "answer": "Nicola Sturgeon: 'No Brexit preferable to no deal'"}
{"question": "Title: Brian Wilson Background: Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Section: Success and record producing Passage: Recording sessions for the band's first album took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August 1962, but early on Brian lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Brian's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Brian fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production - though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.  In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \"Surfin' U.S.A.\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The Surfin' U.S.A. album was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.  Brian was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the Surfer Girl album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Brian decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, Little Deuce Coupe, which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the Surfer Girl LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Brian was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.  For much of the decade, Brian attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, \"Surf City\", which he co-wrote with Jan Berry of Jan and Dean, was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Brian, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean.

{"question": "Title: Foreigner (band) Background: Foreigner is an English-American rock band, originally formed in New York City in 1976 by veteran English musician Mick Jones ex-Spooky Tooth and fellow Briton and ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald along with American vocalist Lou Gramm. Jones came up with the band's name as he, McDonald and Dennis Elliott were British, while Gramm, Al Greenwood and Ed Gagliardi were American. Their biggest hit single, \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", topped the United Kingdom and United States charts among others. They are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time with worldwide sales of more than 80 million records, including 37.5 million records in the US. Section: New frontman Passage: Jones, the founder and only remaining original member of Foreigner, decided to take some time off before looking to form a new lineup in 2004. On July 25, 2004 in Santa Barbara, California at Fess Parker's DoubleTree Resort, Jones appeared at a benefit show for muscular dystrophy with a brand new version of Foreigner that included: Jeff Jacobs, Thom Gimbel, former Dokken bass player Jeff Pilson, future Black Country Communion drummer Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and leader of Bonham) and Bonham singer Chas West. West was front man for that show only and was eventually replaced by former Hurricane singer Kelly Hansen, who had sent the band an audition tape and was invited aboard in March 2005, making his debut with the group on March 11 at Boulder Station near Las Vegas. During their 2005 spring tour, Chas West briefly continued with the band as a special guest, playing rhythm guitar.  Their 2005 BMG album, Extended Versions, featured the new line-up playing all their classic hits live in concert in one of the most \"studio like, clean sounding\" live album recordings produced.  Foreigner joined Def Leppard along with Styx on tour in 2007. They also toured extensively in their own right in 2007 - the thirtieth anniversary of the release of their debut.  In late 2007, keyboardist Jeff Jacobs left Foreigner after 16 years and was replaced, first by Paul Mirkovich then by Michael Bluestein (in 2008). And in 2008, Bonham also parted ways with Foreigner. Bryan Head was then brought in to fill the drum chair. But his tenure was short and he also departed to be replaced by the returning Tichy.  The band released a greatest hits anthology on July 15, 2008, titled No End in Sight: The Very Best of Foreigner. The anthology included all of their greatest hits plus some new live recordings and a new studio track, \"Too Late\", which was their first new song release since the 1994 album Mr. Moonlight and the first recorded output of the new lineup. \"Too Late\" was released as a single on June 17, 2008.

{"question": "Title: Fred Rogers Background: Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers was famous for creating, hosting and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968-2001), which featured his kind-hearted grandfatherly personality, and direct connection to his audiences. Originally trained and ordained as a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children at the time, and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. Rogers developed his own show on WQED in 1968, and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Section: VCR Passage: During the controversy surrounding the introduction of the household VCR, Rogers was involved in supporting the manufacturers of VCRs in court. His 1979 testimony, in the case Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., noted that he did not object to home recordings of his television programs, for instance, by families in order to watch them together at a later time. This testimony contrasted with the views of others in the television industry who objected to home recordings or believed that devices to facilitate it should be taxed or regulated.  When the case reached the Supreme Court in 1983, the majority decision considered the testimony of Rogers when it held that the Betamax video recorder did not infringe copyright. The Court stated that his views were a notable piece of evidence \"that many [television] producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue\" and even quoted his testimony in a footnote:  Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the Neighborhood at hours when some children cannot use it ... I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the Neighborhood off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the Neighborhood because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been \"You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions.\" Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Did Fred Rogers have anything to do with the development of the VCR? Answer: Rogers was involved in supporting the manufacturers of VCRs in court. Question: What was Roger's role in supporting the VCR Answer: His 1979 testimony, in the case Sony Corp. of America v.

There are stations all around the city, so I had to find the one that was closest to my destination so I wouldn't have to walk too far after I got off. When I got to the station, I walked down the stairs that led into the underground and went over to the kiosk so I could pay my fee. After I paid my fee I took the ticket and went through the turnstile towards the train. I had to wait with a group of people for the train to arrive, but it didn't take very long. When the train got to my station the doors slowly slid open and everyone walked inside. We found our seats and waited patiently for the train to start moving. I didn't take long.

{"question": "Title: Tōru Takemitsu Background: Toru Takemitsu (Wu Man  Che , Takemitsu Toru, October 8, 1930 - February 20, 1996) pronounced [takemitsW to:rW] was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. Section: Youth Passage: Takemitsu was born in Tokyo on October 8, 1930; a month later his family moved to Dalian in the Chinese province of Liaoning. In 1938 he returned to Japan to attend elementary school, but his education was cut short by military conscription in 1944. Takemitsu described his experience of military service at such a young age, under the Japanese Nationalist government, as \"... extremely bitter\". Takemitsu first became really conscious of Western classical music during his term of military service, in the form of a popular French Song (\"Parlez-moi d'amour\") which he listened to with colleagues in secret, played on a gramophone with a makeshift needle fashioned from bamboo.  During the post-war U.S. occupation of Japan, Takemitsu worked for the U.S. Armed Forces, but was ill for a long period. Hospitalised and bed-ridden, he took the opportunity to listen to as much Western music as he could on the U.S. Armed Forces network. While deeply affected by these experiences of Western music, he simultaneously felt a need to distance himself from the traditional music of his native Japan. He explained much later, in a lecture at the New York International Festival of the Arts, that for him Japanese traditional music \"always recalled the bitter memories of war\".  Despite his almost complete lack of musical training, and taking inspiration from what little Western music he had heard, Takemitsu began to compose in earnest at the age of 16: \"... I began [writing] music attracted to music itself as one human being. Being in music I found my raison d'etre as a man. After the war, music was the only thing. Choosing to be in music clarified my identity.\" Though he studied briefly with Yasuji Kiyose beginning in 1948, Takemitsu remained largely self-taught throughout his musical career. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where was Toru born? Answer: Takemitsu was born in Tokyo Question: When was he born? Answer: October 8, 1930; Question: Who was his family? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Where did he go to school? Answer: In 1938 he returned to Japan to attend elementary school, but his education was cut short by military conscription in 1944.

Classify each post into the following categories : AUTHOR (if the author of the post is wrong in the situation), OTHER (if any of the others mentioned in the paragraph is wrong), EVERYBODY (if everyone mentioned is wrong) and NOBODY (if no one is wrong in the situation).   I'm from America but live in Australia and invited my good friend and ex boyfriend out to come stay with me rent free for up to a year on a visa. For some background, he was figuring out what he wanted to do with his life and had never traveled much. I told him that he could figure out his life and study for the MCAT anywhere, so he might as well come someplace beautiful and hang out with me. We had dated very seriously for 2 years about 6 years ago and we've been very close for the past 4 years. He got excited about spending time with me and exploring Australia and agreed to come out. We were just friends at the time, but were flirting heavily. We both knew it was a temporary situation since he couldn't stay here for more than a year, so we set some ground rules. We agreed to be exclusive while he was living with me, but that it wasn't going to be a forever thing. Basically, we said that if we were sleeping together, we weren't going to pursue other people. And I told him that we could either just be friends or we could be together, but I felt uncomfortable with him flirting with and sexting other women while sleeping with me. You can see where this is going. About 6 months into his staying with me, he's on his laptop and gets a sext from some girl. I'm sitting next to him so I see it and ask about it. He slams the laptop shut and denies anything. I get suspicious and press him for more info about her. He gets angry and says to mind my own business and it doesn't involve me. So, I, very shittily, look through his facebook messages one day when he left his laptop out and see that he's been flirting with several women the entire time he's been living with me, including with a girl who flew to my city to meet up with him. So he's been lying to me for 6 months. He knew I would not want to continue sleeping with him if i knew about his side chicks. So he hid them and continued to have sex and be romantic with me. But he swears he never had sex with anyone else, even the girl who saw him here. I tell him I never want to speak to him again and ask him to leave my place. I give him 2 weeks to make other arrangements. But it's hard because I know he doesn't have a lot of money and he will have to stay at an Airbnb or cheap hotel. And he has to book a flight back to America which will be expensive. So, I feel bad. For snooping and for kicking him out. He swears he never cheated on me, it was just flirting. But he knew I would have chosen to stop sleeping with him if I knew, and I feel like that decision was taken from me. I just feel disrespected and a little violated.  Also, he never paid rent or anything and my name is the only one on the lease if that helps. He paid me 100 bucks once for all the extra utilities, but that doesn't come close to covering it. It was just a gesture since he is kind of broke. He's a good guy otherwise. He just doesn't seem to respect me very much. But am I overreacting? Am I the asshole here?  TLDR: my ex boyfriend came to live with me in Australia from America. I snooped on his laptop after I saw that he received a sext and he acted shady. He's been flirting with many women. I gave him about 2 weeks to move out. He's pretty broke and it will cost him a lot to rent a place and buy a flight back to America.", "answer": "OTHER"}

{"question": "Title: Matt Hardy Background: Hardy was born in Cameron, North Carolina, the son of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy. He is the older brother of Jeff Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986. Hardy played baseball as a child and throughout high school, but had stopped by his senior year. Section: Version 1 (2002-2004) Passage: At the beginning of 2002, it seemed Team Xtreme had patched things up. After the brand extension, however, Hardy was relegated to Heat while Jeff wrestled on the main show, Raw. On the August 12 episode of Raw, Hardy turned against Jeff during Jeff's match against Rob Van Dam, because Hardy was frustrated at not receiving a match against Van Dam for the number one contendership for the Intercontinental Championship. A short time later, Hardy joined the SmackDown! roster, and began dubbing himself \"Matt Hardy: Version 1\", complete with a \"version 1\" hand signal. Hardy defeated The Undertaker on the September 12 and October 3 episodes of the show, due to interference from Brock Lesnar.  Along with his MF'er (Mattitude Follower) Shannon Moore in his corner, 2003 began with Hardy frantically trying to lose weight to get under the 215 lb (98 kg) weight limit to compete for the Cruiserweight Championship. After just barely making weight, Hardy defeated Billy Kidman at No Way Out to win the Cruiserweight title. At WrestleMania XIX, he successfully defended it against Rey Mysterio. Hardy lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Mysterio in the main event of the June 5 edition of SmackDown - the first and only time a Cruiserweight Championship match main evented a show.  After dropping the Cruiserweight Championship, Hardy briefly feuded with Eddie Guerrero, but was unsuccessful in capturing Guerrero's United States Championship or Tag Team Championship. The Mattitude faction then expanded to include Crash Holly as Moore's \"Moore-on\" (apprentice). He later disbanded the group in November and returned to Raw in order to be able to travel and work with his then girlfriend Lita, who just returned from an injury. On his first night back, he turned on Lita in storyline after teasing a proposal to her. He defeated Christian, who was vying for Lita's affections, on the following edition of Raw.  In April 2004, Hardy saved Lita from getting attacked by Kane. Hardy defeated Kane at Vengeance, but lost a match against Kane at SummerSlam.

{"question": "In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Your task is to generate answer \"yes\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \"no\".   Review: - After their sons are sentenced to life in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone fells their sons got off easy. The pair decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life. They start a dance school that is soon very successful. One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. In the meantime, Helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio. It's only a mater of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder.- I can't help but compare What's the Matter with Helen? to Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, also starring Shelly Winters. Where that movie seemed almost restrained in its presentation of Auntie Roo's madness, there's nothing holding Helen back in this movie. It may take a good deal of the movie's running time, but once she snaps, Helen is one Bad Mad Mutha. You don't want to mess with her. Winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but the things Helen is capable of are totally over-the-top.- As good as Winters is, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as the gold-digging tap dancer. I got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some award. This ain't Citizen Kane! Quit acting so serious. Hey, Debbie, don't you realize that you're main purpose is to be a victim of Winters' insanity.- I just love these former-female-stars-in-the-twilight-of-their-career horror movies.

Section: HBS (Hot Buttered Soul Records) and bankruptcy Passage: By 1974, Stax Records was having serious financial problems, stemming from problems with overextension and limited record sales and distribution. Hayes himself was deep in debt to Union Planters Bank, which administered loans for the Stax label and many of its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for $5.3 million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes's income and apply it towards his debts. Hayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through ABC Records.  His new album, 1975's Chocolate Chip, saw Hayes embrace the disco sound with the title track and lead single. \"I Can't Turn Around\" would prove a popular song as time went on. This would be Hayes's last album to chart in the top 40 for many years. Later in the year, the all-instrumental Disco Connection album fully embraced disco.  In 1976, the album cover of Juicy Fruit featured Hayes in a pool with naked women, and spawned the title track single and the classic \"Storm Is Over\". Later the same year the Groove-A-Thon album featured the singles \"Rock Me Easy Baby\" and the title track. However, while all these albums were regarded as solid efforts, Hayes was no longer selling large numbers. He and his wife were forced into bankruptcy in 1976, as they owed over $6 million. By the end of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1977, Hayes had lost his home, much of his personal property, and the rights to all future royalties earned from the music he had written, performed, and produced.

{"question": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question.   Background Paragraph: Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.  Story: Scientists studied two island. One with an old ecosystem named Old island, and the other with a newly formed and forming ecosystem named New island. Both islands were inhabited, Old island being heavily inhabited.  Question: Which island had a less stable ecosystem factoring in the population?", "answer": "Old."}

{"question": "Title: MC5 Background: MC5 was an American rock band from Lincoln Park, Michigan, formed in 1964. The original band line-up consisted of vocalist Rob Tyner, guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred \"Sonic\" Smith, bassist Michael Davis, and drummer Dennis Thompson. \"Crystallizing the counterculture movement at its most volatile and threatening\", according to AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the MC5's leftist political ties and anti-establishment lyrics and music positioned them as emerging innovators of the punk movement in the United States. Section: Early years Passage: The origins of MC5 can be traced to the friendship between guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred Smith. Friends since their teen years, they were both fans of R&B music, blues, Chuck Berry, Dick Dale, The Ventures, and what would later be called garage rock: they adored any music with speed, energy and a rebellious attitude. Each guitarist/singer formed and led a rock group (Smith's Vibratones and Kramer's Bounty Hunters). As members of both groups left for college or straight jobs, the most committed members eventually united (under Kramer's leadership and the \"Bounty Hunters\" name) with Billy Vargo on guitar and Leo LeDuc on drums (at this point Smith played bass), and were popular and successful enough in and around Detroit that the musicians were able to quit their day jobs and make a living from the group.  Kramer felt they needed a manager, which led him to Rob Derminer, a few years older than the others, and deeply involved in Detroit's hipster and left-wing political scenes. Derminer originally auditioned as a bass guitarist (a role which he held briefly in 1964, with Smith switching to guitar to replace Vargo and with Bob Gaspar replacing LeDuc), though they quickly realized that his talents could be better used as a lead singer: Though not conventionally attractive and rather paunchy by traditional frontman standards, he nonetheless had a commanding stage presence, and a booming baritone voice that evidenced his abiding love of American soul and gospel music. Derminer renamed himself Rob Tyner (after Coltrane's pianist McCoy Tyner). Tyner also invented their new name, MC5: it reflected their Detroit roots (it was short for \"Motor City Five'). In some ways the group was similar to other garage bands of the period, composing soon-to-be historic workouts such as \"Black to Comm\" during their mid-teens in the basement of the home of Kramer's mother. Upon Tyner's switch from bassist to vocalist, he was initially replaced by Patrick Burrows, however the lineup was stabilised in 1965 by the arrival of Michael Davis and Dennis Thompson to replace Burrows and Gaspar respectively.  The music also reflected Smith and Kramer's increasing interest in free jazz--the guitarists were inspired by the likes of Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Sun Ra and late period John Coltrane, and tried to imitate the ecstatic sounds of the squealing, high-pitched saxophonists they adored. MC5 even later opened for a few U.S. midwest shows for Sun Ra, whose influence is obvious in \"Starship\". Kramer and Smith were also deeply inspired by Sonny Sharrock, one of the few electric guitarists working in free jazz, and they eventually developed a unique interlocking style that was like little heard before: Kramer's solos often used a heavy, irregular vibrato, while Smith's rhythms contained an uncommon explosive energy, including patterns that conveyed great excitement, as evidenced in \"Black to Comm\" and many other songs.

Nelba Marquez-Green's daughter Ana Grace was one of 26 killed by Adam Lanza during his Dec. 14, 2012, shooting spree. She also has a son who was at the school at the time of the shooting and was uninjured. In her letter published on the Education Week website, Marquez-Green praised educators as heroes and described how impressed she was by the teachers at Sandy Hook who came back to work after the tragedy. Promise: Greene and Marquez-Greene hold a photo of Ana at an emotional January press conference. Marquez-Greene has written an emotional letter lauding America's teachers . ‘It takes guts to be a teacher,’ she wrote. ‘Six brave women gave their lives trying to protect their students at Sandy Hook. Other teachers were forced to run from the building, stepping over the bodies of their friends and colleagues, and they came right back to work. ‘While I pray you will never find yourself in the position of the teachers at Sandy Hook, your courage will support students like my son, who have lived through traumas no child should have to,’ she wrote.

In her letter, Marquez-Greene also emphasized ways to prevent future Sandy Hooks. She said teachers are the key to having an impact on students who are ‘left out and overlooked, like the isolated young man who killed my daughter.’ ‘At some point he was a young, impressionable student, often sitting all alone at school,’ she wrote. ‘You will have kids facing long odds for whom your smile, your encouraging word, and your willingness to go the extra mile will provide the comfort and security they need to try again tomorrow.’ Marquez-Greene said the only letter of the 15,000 she received after the shooting that she keeps at her bedside is one from her own high school English teacher. ‘Real heroes don't wear capes,’ she wrote. ‘They work in America's schools.’ Summarize the above article in 3 sentences.", "answer": "Nelba Marquez-Greene lost her 6-year-old girl Ana in the December massacre .

Article: On an August afternoon last year, Pamela Rivers, 40, and her friend Rita Graham, 38, were stopped at a red light on Cobb's Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them. It then jumped the curb   and rushed through a grassy expanse   before plunging down an embankment   toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911. Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window. \"I have a fear of water,\" Kenny said now. \"I almost drowned when I was nine.\" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. \"I couldn't just leave her,\" he adds. The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt. \"Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,\" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl. That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. \"I flipped into rescue mode,\" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out. Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock. \"Give her CPR!\" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. \"Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,\" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, \"Pump her chest!\" \"We tried three times,\" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water. Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat. Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. \"We couldn't believe she was all right,\" said Pamela. \"It's just amazing that these people came together,\" said Cheryl. She stays in touch with her \"angels\" via frequent phone calls. \"They are really beautiful people,\" she said.   Question: Which telephone number do Chinese dial in the case like that where Pamela in the passage dialed \"911\"?   Options: (A) 121. (B) 120. (C) 114. (D) 12315.", "answer": "B"}

Paragraph: A heart surgeon and his team performs a complex mitral valve reconstruction at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge July 5, 2007. REUTERS/Ben Edwards Among patients admitted to the hospital for a heart attack, women were far less likely than men to get angiography in which blood vessels are injected with dye so that blockages are visible on an X-ray, or angioplasty to clear blockages, a study found. Women were about twice as likely as men to die within a month of a heart attack, the study said. “This suggests that we could reduce mortality in female patients by using more invasive procedures,” said Dr. Francois Schiele, chief cardiologist at the University Hospital of Besancon, France. Schiele, who presented the research at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta, said women should be treated with all recommended strategies, including invasive ones. Some earlier studies have also suggested that women have a higher risk of death after a heart attack than men, but it is unclear why. Biological differences might explain it, researchers said, but there were also substantial differences in the treatment regimens women received. Researchers analyzed data from a registry that included more than 3,500 patients who were treated for heart attacks between January 2006 and December 2007. The women, who made up almost one-third of the patients, were nine years older than the men on average and had more health problems. In most major heart studies, the majority of patients have been men, leaving women an understudied population. The French study, sponsored by European drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis, found women received fewer effective treatments for heart attack. Women were almost twice as likely to die during the initial hospital stay and during the following month. Dr. Marcelo Di Carli, director of Cardiovascular Imaging at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, noted that the risk of death is higher in women with heart disease than in men and the women in this study were older and sicker in the first place. Carli, who was not involved in this study, said he was not surprised by the findings, but noted that there is a growing awareness that women’s heart attack symptoms are different from men’s symptoms. “Just about every major hospital in the United States has a program on women’s health. Things are changing in a positive way because there’s so much research,” he said, adding that there is a recognition that women have different symptoms then men and sometimes no symptoms. One important difference, he said, is that women tend to have problems in smaller blood vessels, rather than the main coronary arteries. “This disease looks different in women,” Carli added.

Lottery scratchcards whose £100,000 prizes have already been won are still on sale, an investigation has revealed. The £2 cards are being sold in shops, supermarkets and petrol stations across the UK – despite the fact that all five top prizes have been claimed. National Lottery operator Camelot says the £100,000 red Cash cards can legally remain on sale, but Martin Lewis, of the Money Saving Expert website, said: ‘One would hope that if you are buying a scratchcard that advertises a chance to win a £100,000 prize, you actually have a chance. No chance: The £100,000 red Cash scratchcards are still on sale in UK stores despite all five top prizes having been claimed . ‘Camelot should be doing everything to . communicate the situation over the cards or be withdrawing the cards . and replacing them with a new tranche. ‘I think many people playing would be . disappointed to know there’s no chance of a dream win. With these cards, . it truly could not be you.’ About 12million of the cards were printed with the odds of scooping the jackpot standing at almost 2.5million-to-one. Now all the five jackpots have gone, players have chances to win prizes worth £2 to £5,000. No problem: National Lottery operator Camelot has said that the continued sale of the scratchcards is legal . The unwinnable cards are still . available in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Cambridge, . Plymouth and Glasgow, an investigation by The Sun has revealed. A Camelot spokesman said: ‘All the top prizes have now been won and we have ceased distribution of the game. ‘However, there are still thousands of . other prizes available and, as agreed with our regulator [the Gambling Commission], retailers can . continue to sell the stock they have activated for sale.’ A spokesman for the Advertising . Standards Authority said last night that it would launch an investigation into alleged advertising irregularlities if any complaints were lodged. Players took to Twitter to voice their . anger. One user, Bingobrewtew, said: ‘I don’t do it any more, greedy . Camelot!’ Anger: Camelot already sparked fury by announcing that it will be doubling the price of tickets for its main draws to £2 . Harlow MP Robert Halfon tweeted: . ‘Camelot have some serious questions to answer as to whether public are . being ripped off.’ He earlier questioned: ‘Do we need new National . Lottery operators? Are Camelot taking us for a ride?’ Lottery chiefs also came under fire . last month after announcing they were doubling the price of the main . draws ticket to £2 this autumn.

As well as the rise, average weekend . jackpots will go up to £5million in a revamp of the main Lotto game. The . prize for getting three numbers will rise from £10 to £25, and the . prize for matching four will go from £60 to £100. A new raffle prize of £20,000 will go to at least 50 Lotto players every week. However, other prizes will fall. Camelot said research revealed the . Lotto draw was ‘getting a bit tired and jaded’ and customers wanted . ‘more prizes and more ways to win’.

{"question": "Title: Al Kaline Background: Kaline was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. His family was poor. Several relatives played semi-pro baseball, but no one in his family had graduated from high school. When he was eight years old, Kaline developed osteomyelitis and had a segment of bone removed from his left foot. Section: Final seasons Passage: In 1970 Kaline was nearly a victim of a freak accident on the baseball field. On May 30, 1970, in a game at Milwaukee's County Stadium, Kaline collided with center fielder Jim Northrup as they both pursued a flyball. Kaline fell to the warning track injured. Alertly, left fielder Willie Horton rushed over and quickly recognized that Kaline was turning blue. Horton reached in and cleared Kaline's airway, saving his life.  After hitting .294 in 1971, Kaline became the first Tiger to sign a $100,000 ($604,273 in today's dollars) contract. He had turned down a pay raise from $95,000 to $100,000 the previous year, saying he did not feel like he deserved it after hitting .278 with 21 home runs in 1970. Detroit contended all season for the 1972 pennant, trailing the Red Sox by a half-game before a series against them to end the regular season. Kaline batted eight times in two games, registering five hits and three runs scored. Detroit won those first two games and clinched the AL East pennant. They lost the ALCS to the Oakland Athletics that year after Reggie Jackson stole home in the final game of the series. In March 1973, Kaline won the Roberto Clemente Award in recognition of the honor he brought to baseball on and off the field.  On September 24, 1974, Kaline became the 12th player in MLB history to reach the 3000 hit plateau, when he hit a double off the Orioles' Dave McNally. After reaching the milestone, he announced that he would retire. \"I'm glad it's over. I really am. I don't think I'll miss it. I may miss spring training\", Kaline said after his last game on October 3. He finished his career with 3,007 hits (25th on the all-time list), 399 home runs (a Tigers record and 43rd on the all-time list), 1,622 runs scored, and 1,582 RBIs. He batted over .300 nine times in his career to finish with a lifetime batting average of .297 and hit 25 or more home runs seven times in his career. He also holds Tiger career records for games played (2,834), walks (1,277) and sacrifice flies (104). CANNOTANSWER  Question: Were his final seasons successful?

He founded the Getty Oil Company, and in 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American, while the 1966 Guinness Book of Records named him as the world's richest private citizen, worth an estimated $1.2 billion (approximately $9.05 billion in 2017). At his death, he was worth more than $6 billion (approximately $25.80 billion in 2017). Section: Later years & death Passage: On June 30, 1960, Getty threw a 21st birthday party for a relation of his friend, the 16th Duke of Norfolk, which served as a housewarming party for the newly-purchased Sutton Place. 1,200 guests consisting of the cream of British society were invited. Party goers were irritated by Getty's stinginess, such as not providing cigarettes and relegating everyone to using creosote portable toilets outside. At about 10pm the party descended into pandemonium as party crashers arrived from London, swelling the already overcrowded halls, causing an estimated L20,000 in damages. A valuable silver ewer by the 18th century silversmith Paul de Lamerie was stolen, but returned anonymously when the London newspapers began covering the theft. The failure of the event made the newly-arrived Getty the object of ridicule, and he never threw another large party again.  Getty remained an inveterate hard worker, boasting at age 74 that he often worked 16 to 18 hours per day overseeing his operations across the world. The Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War of October 1973 caused a worldwide oil shortage for years to come. In this period, the value of Getty Oil shares quadrupled, with Getty enjoying personal earnings of $25.8 million in 1975 (appr. $120 million in 2018 USD).  His insatiable appetite for women and sex also continued well into his 80s. He used an experimental drug, \"H3\", to maintain his potency. Getty met the English interior designer Penelope Kitson in the 1950s and entrusted her with decorating his homes and the public rooms of the oil tankers he was launching. From 1960 she resided in a cottage on the grounds of Sutton Place, and, though she did not have a sexual relationship with him, Getty held her in high respect and trust. Other mistresses who resided at Sutton Place included the married Mary Teissier, a distant cousin of the last Tsar of Russia, Lady Ursula d'Abo, who had close connections to the British Royal Family, and Nicaraguan-born Rosabella Burch.  The New York Times wrote of Getty's domestic arrangement that: \"[Getty] ended his life with a collection of desperately hopeful women, all living together in his Tudor mansion in England, none of them aware that his favorite pastime was rewriting his will, changing his insultingly small bequests: $209 a month to one, $1,167 to another.\" Only Penelope Kitson received a handsome bequest upon Getty's death: 5,000 Getty Oil shares (appr. $826,500 in 1976), which doubled in value during the 1980s, and a $1,167 monthly income.  Getty died June 6, 1976, in Sutton Place near Guildford, Surrey, England. He was buried in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles County, California at the Getty Villa. The gravesite is not open to the public. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did Getty die? Answer: Getty died June 6, 1976, Question: What was the cause of his death?

{"question": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words.   By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter Bridget and Jonathan Reid, from Moy, near Tomatin in the Highlands, tied the knot at Nevis Range, near Fort William, on Friday. The couple first's date six years ago was a skiing trip, so they decided it would be appropriate to get married on skis. Adventure photographer Hamish Frost took their wedding snaps. Bridget, who is a teacher, and Jonathan, who runs his own electrical automation company, benefited from recent snowfalls for their big day. They got married in full Highland dress, which includes a kilt, and white wedding dress surrounded by snow-covered mountain landscape. The white stuff had been lacking over winter, but last month's Storm Doris and recent spells of colder weather have helped with the operation of Nevis Range and Scotland's other outdoor ski centres. The newly weds said: \"Over the last couple of years we have spent as many weekends as possible skiing the Back Corries at Nevis Range. \"We love the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff and the amazing terrain for skiing. When we heard that we could actually get married there it was a no-brainer.\" The couple got married at the top of Easy Gully in a ceremony officiated by Halde Pottinger from the Humanist Society of Scotland. \"He was totally up for marrying us on skis and did an amazing job. He is currently trying to establish whether or not we are the first wedding actually conducted and vowed in skis - officiate and couple,\" said the Reids. \"We can't actually believe we are but there can't be many. We also managed to twist the arm of adventure photographer Hamish Frost, who came along to take photographs.\" The couple added: \"The day could not have been better. Without doubt it was the best conditions of the year - with blue skies and fresh snow, we could not have asked for more.\" They thanked the staff of Nevis Range for \"a fabulous job making our day possible\", and for helping in throwing \"a hell of a good party\" in the evening.

{"question": "Title: Journey (band) Background: Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \"Open Arms\". Section: 1981-1983: Height of popularity Passage: With Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \"Escape\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \"Who's Cryin' Now\", \"Don't Stop Believin'\" and \"Open Arms\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans.  Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600.  This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time.  Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\", which reached No. 8, \"Faithfully\", which reached No. 12, \"Send Her My Love\" and \"After the Fall\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world. During the subsequent stadium tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond. Scenes from the documentary were shot at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with more than 80,000 fans in attendance. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did they reach their peak of popularity?

{"question": "Title: Octavia E. Butler Background: Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, California, the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven, so Octavia was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict Baptist environment. Growing up in the racially integrated community of Pasadena allowed Butler to experience cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of racial segregation. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work, where the two entered white people's houses through back doors, as workers. Section: Interviews Passage: Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 soon after the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The highlights are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, \"What then is central to what you want to say about race?\" Butler's response was, \"Do I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?\" This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.  In an interview by Randall Kenan, Octavia E. Butler discusses how her life experiences as a child shaped most of her thinking. As a writer, Butler was able to use her writing as a vehicle to critique history under the lenses of feminism. In the interview, she discusses the research that had to be done in order to write her bestselling novel, Kindred. Most of it is based on visiting libraries as well as historic landmarks with respect to what she is investigating. Butler admits that she writes science fiction because she does not want her work to be labeled or used as a marketing tool. She wants the readers to be genuinely interested in her work and the story she provides, but at the same time she fears that people will not read her work because of the \"science fiction\" label that they have.  In an interview with Joshunda Sanders, Butler commented on the space race and its influence on her work. She noted, \"I think of the space race as a way of having a nuclear war without having one.\" She the claimed that Ronald Reagan believed a nuclear war against the Soviet Union was winnable. Butler admitted to being very confused by this idea, and said that it contributed to her idea for the Xenogenesis books. She said \"there must be something basic, something really genetically wrong with us if we're falling for this stuff.\" Butler then commented on how she felt a real fear about nuclear war during the Cold War and that these ideas had a real influence on some of her early works.  In an interview with Marilyn Mehaffy and AnaLouise Keating, for MELUS, Octavia Butler talked about how biology is used to keep groups of people out of power. She said, \"What's made of biology is that the people who are in power are going to figure out why this is a good reason for them to stay in power. Look at the tests that show that women have better linguistic abilities: Yet, how many of our ambassadors are women? How many of the politicians are women? This is not looked at; instead, the argument goes that women don't have the mathematical abilities. . . every now and then. So we're much more likely now to be penalized for whatever we're assumed not to have. We're much more likely to find that whatever little genetic thing that's discovered is going to be used against us.\"  The issue of biology defining women and what they can and can't do has long been a part of feminism.

{"question": "Consider an m * n matrix A and an n * m matrix B (with n != m) such that AB = I_m. Are the columns of A linearly independent? Relevant Theorem: Linear independence is a concept in algebra, particularly in linear algebra, that refers to the relationship between vectors in a vector space. A set of vectors is said to be linearly independent if none of the vectors in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors. In other words, no vector in the set can be created by adding or subtracting multiples of the other vectors.  Mathematically, a set of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn} is linearly independent if the only solution to the equation:  c1 * v1 + c2 * v2 + ... + cn * vn = 0  is when all the coefficients c1, c2, ..., cn are equal to zero. Here, 0 represents the zero vector.  If there exists a non-zero solution for the coefficients, then the set of vectors is said to be linearly dependent. In this case, at least one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.

{"question": "Title: Trapped in the Closet (South Park) Background: \"Trapped in the Closet\" is the twelfth episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series South Park. The 137th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16, 2005. In the episode, Stan joins Scientology in an attempt to find something \"fun and free\". After the discovery of his surprisingly high \"thetan levels\", he is recognized as the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the church. Section: Production Passage: South Park had previously parodied Scientology in a spoof at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The MTV short was titled \"The Gauntlet\" and included \"John Travolta and the Church of Scientology\" arriving in a spaceship to defeat Russell Crowe (as a gladiator) and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film Battlefield Earth. They had also made fun of Scientology in an earlier episode, titled \"Super Best Friends\", in which David Blaine formed his own cult, called \"Blaintology\". Parker and Stone have acknowledged that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology.  Parker stated that Isaac Hayes' membership had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology. However, the decision to ultimately produce a South Park episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show's creators have with Penn Jillette. Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of Bullshit! based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology. Parker commented, \"We're going, That's fucked up. And hearing other people say, 'You can't do that' - you can only say 'You can't do that' so many times to Matt and me before we're gonna do it. Finally, we just had to tell Isaac, 'Dude, we totally love working with you, and this is nothing personal, it's just we're South Park, and if we don't do this, we're belittling everything else we've ripped on.'\"  Although some questions were raised prior to the episode's screening about whether it was wise to take swipes at Cruise and Scientology, Comedy Central declared that it supported Stone and Parker. A Comedy Central spokesman told Radar magazine in November 2005 that \"they are free, and have been, to satirize anybody and anything they want to. They've made fun of MTV, they've made fun of Viacom, they've made fun of Comedy Central, and we've never interfered with them.\"  During production on the episode, investigative journalist Mark Ebner served as a consultant to Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood, Interrupted, which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood, and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta's relationship to Scientology. On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode, it is asserted that the section of \"Trapped in the Closet\" that explains Scientology's portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated: \"Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously.\" The title is a reference to the R. Kelly song of the same name, and a depiction of R. Kelly appears in the episode to sing a parody of it. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Was there any conflict during the production of this episode? Answer: Isaac Hayes' membership had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology. Question: Did Issac Hayes participate in the production of the episode? Answer: Finally, we just had to tell Isaac, 'Dude, we totally love working with you, and this is nothing personal, Question: Did production have to be put on hold because of the conflict?

{"question": "Title: The Man with the Golden Arm Background: The Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American drama film with elements of film noir, based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren, which tells the story of a drug addict who gets clean while in prison, but struggles to stay that way in the outside world. Although the addictive drug is never identified in the film, according to the American Film Institute \"most contemporary and modern sources assume that it is heroin\", in contrast to Algren's book which named the drug as morphine. The film stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin. It was adapted for the screen by Walter Newman, Lewis Meltzer and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and directed by Otto Preminger. Section: Controversy over release Passage: Preminger decided to release the finished film prior to submitting it for a Code seal of approval. He contended that his film would not entice any viewers to take drugs, since drug use was depicted as having severely negative consequences. The black-and-white film was also the first to portray heroin use as a serious literary topic, rejecting the standard \"dope fiend\" approach of the time. United Artists, which had invested $1 million in the film's production, opted to distribute the film, even though doing so could result in the company being fined $25,000 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The president of United Artists, Arthur Krim, expressed the company's hope that the PCA would make an exception to its usual rules and grant the film approval because of the film's \"immense potential for public service.\" The film received several advance bookings in November and early December 1955, before the PCA had made a decision on whether to grant a Code seal.  However, in early December 1955, the PCA denied the film a Code seal, and the decision was upheld upon appeal to the MPAA. As a result, United Artists resigned from the MPAA that same month (although the company re-joined a few years later). The National Legion of Decency also showed disagreement with the PCA ruling by rating the film as a \"B\" meaning \"morally objectionable in part for all\", instead of a \"C\" meaning \"condemned\", which was the rating normally given to films that were denied a Code seal. Large theater circuits including Loews also refused to ban the film and instead showed it despite the lack of a Code seal. As a result of the controversy, the MPAA investigated and revised production codes, allowing later movies more freedom to deeply explore hitherto taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, miscegenation, abortion, and prostitution.  In the end, The Man With The Golden Arm finally received the Production Code seal number 17011 in June 1961, which permitted the film to be reissued and sold for television broadcast. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what were the controversies? Answer: the PCA denied the film a Code seal, Question: why did they do that? Answer: Preminger decided to release the finished film prior to submitting it for a Code seal of approval. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.   Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : So I have two good friend who are a couple and every few months they host a dinner party where we drink and eat together pot-luck style.   It makes them really happy and they look forward to it each time and it's important for them. And honestly, I love it too!  But during the last dinner party, I wasn't able to be myself due to catching a last-minute cold or something.   My throat was sore to the point that swallowing anything (food included) was painful. My head was pounding like I had an angry man inside trying to escape, and every noise (even the background music and conversation) sent shooting pains to my head.   So naturally, I'm just wishing for the whole thing to be over. I'm here to support my friends because they expect me to be there, and nothing more.   I don't engage much in dinner conversation with the other guests, don't really say much at all, and look pretty glum the whole time due to my headache.   Don't get me wrong: when someone spoke directly to me, I smiled and put on an act of enjoying myself. But in-between those periods, I looked like a zombie.   I also keep stealthily checking my phone during the party waiting for a reasonable time to make an excuse to leave (which the hosts apparently noticed).   At the end, my friends confronted me that I was being very rude the whole time for not looking like I was enjoying myself.

So I dated a girl for a few months, it was shaping up to be a longterm thing, but things went bad. We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids.   This was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me.

He is best known for his solo material, and as a member of Fistful of Mercy and RNDM. Combining poetic lyrics with a layered sonic palette, Arthur has built his reputation over the years through critically acclaimed releases and constant touring; his unique solo live performances often incorporate the use of a number of distortion and loop pedals, and his shows are recorded live at the soundboard and made available to concertgoers immediately following the show on recordable media. Arthur was discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-1990s, and signed to Gabriel's Real World label as the first North American artist on the label's roster.

They formed in Fremantle in 1998 with Jason McGann on drums and Gavin Shoesmith on bass. By 2009, the trio consisted of Butler with Byron Luiters on bass and Nicky Bomba on drums and percussion, the latter being replaced by Grant Gerathy in 2013. The band's second studio album, Three (2001) reached the top 30 in the Australian album charts and achieved platinum sales. Section: Early career Passage: The John Butler Trio is fronted by John Butler on vocals and guitars. He started his career as a busker in Fremantle, Western Australia and released a self-recorded cassette, Searching for Heritage in 1996. Gavin Shoesmith on double bass and bass guitar founded Katamaran in Darwin with Mark Hoffman on didgeridoo and Grant Smith on percussion. With Butler, Shoesmith and Jason McGann on drums, John Butler Trio was formed in Fremantle in 1998 and independently released the John Butler album in December. It was produced by Butler and included re-recorded versions of two tracks from his Searching for Heritage.  The trio toured throughout Western Australia in 1999, then The Waifs invited Butler to perform solo on their Australian tour - he also performed his own gigs. The John Butler Trio then launched their own tour where Butler met his future wife Danielle Caruana in Broome.  The John Butler Trio released the four-track extended play, JBT, in April 2000 with songs short enough to win radio play. It was produced by Butler and Shaun O'Callaghan. Radio station Triple J chose the track \"Pickapart\" to put on high rotation. The band began to develop a wider reputation with a performance at the East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival in Byron Bay in 2000. Butler recalled that his first gig had about 50 people, the second gig started the same way when \"it absolutely pissed with rain and 3000 people ran into our tent. And the show just went berserk. It was like a suffocated fire - you lift the lid and it explodes\". The John Butler Trio has become a regular artist at the annual event. CANNOTANSWER  Question: who founded trio?

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   Human behavior has long engaged in collective behavior assembling in crowds. The Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land has been recorded since the 4th century, while the Hajj, Islam's great pilgrimage, has existed for fourteen centuries, of which a body of literature devoted to the travelogues of the Hajj has been recorded for over ten centuries. Football is a sport played worldwide by more than 1.5 million teams and in 300,000 clubs. Most however play outside of the officially organized sphere: more than 4 percent of the global population plays football, including 270 million amateur players. Assembling for specific events is a uniquely human behavior, though the formal study of crowds did not begin until the mid-Twentieth Century. Today Mass Gathering Medicine focuses on the public health challenges to hosting events attended by a large enough number of people, at a specific site, for a defined period of time, likely to strain both the planning and response to the mass gathering of a community, state, or nation. All of us can recall attending a mass gathering, whether it be watching one's favorite rock group in performance or assembling for religious pilgrimage. Certainly, the event itself is transporting and transforming and the unison of behaviors and activities can be enormously enriching, uplifting and overwhelming, just as much as they may be at times dangerous and high risk. This review seeks to draw contrasts and comparisons between sporting gatherings and religious gatherings with a chief focus on Hajj, among the largest of all mass gatherings today. We will find there are some powerful similarities as well as stark differences. Each bequeaths a legacy which can inform the other and, as we make our observations, we join with you and the legions of other investigators who continue to remain fascinated and enthralled by mass gatherings which are among the most beloved and beholden events of modern humanity.", "answer": "From the \"Madding Crowd\" to mass gatherings-religion, sport, culture and public health"}

So me (23f) and my fiancé (33m) have been together for two years. He’s honestly amazing and I’d do anything for him, hence what I did a couple months ago:  So he’s terrible with his money. He had a lot of debt and had no idea how to manage his finances. So he let me take over and become his accountant.   I have a bank account I set up in both of our names that all his bills gets paid from. This includes our rent and utilities (that we split) and his bills like his car, car insurance, and what not.   He had a lot of credit card debt, but because his credit score was so terrible, he couldn’t get approved for a no interest balance transfer. So I put it in my name. (I KNOW I KNOW but hey I’m gonna marry him so does it matter anyway??)  So whatever money is left from his paycheck after all the bills gets direct deposited into his own bank account. This ranges from 100-200 depending on how many hours he worked that week.   So here’s my problem.. he smokes weed a lot. No big deal, it’s legal here and I don’t mind. Except it’s his number one priority when it comes to his money. He overdrafted his account last week to buy some and due to the overdraft fees and not the greatest paycheck this week, he didn’t have much this week and overdrafted again. (It’s only Sunday and he has to make it until Thursday)  Now the reason I’m really upset is because I added him to my AMEX and told him he can use it whenever he’s in a bind. He uses it all the time. And it adds up, so now I got myself in some debt. He also kept his own personal credit card during this time for emergencies and racked up a balance on that, which he can’t pay for because he keeps overreacting his account to buy weed.   So all my hard work in getting his credit score up is for nothing because of all his missed payments on the other credit card.   I’m just defeated and as much as I love him, I don’t know how I can go further with someone like this.   Please help.", "answer": "ending it with my fiancé because he's terrible with money"}

{"question": "Title: Luis Antonio Tagle Background: Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle (Tagalog: [lU'wis an'tonIo 'tagle]; born June 21, 1957) is the 32nd Archbishop of Manila. He has been Archbishop since December 12, 2011, and a cardinal since November 24, 2012. He also serves as President of Caritas International, a federation of Catholic relief, development, and social service organizations, and of the Catholic Biblical Federation. Tagle has become involved in many social issues in the Philippines with emphasis on helping the poor while maintaining opposition against what he terms \"practical atheism\", abortion, and contraception (equated with abortion in the Philippines). Section: Bishop of Imus Passage: In 2001, Tagle was appointed Bishop of Imus on October 22 and consecrated on December 12 after previously serving as parish priest of the Cathedral-parish of Imus. During his ten years in Imus, he made a point of living simply, owned no car, and invited the destitute to join him for a meal. At the first gathering of bishops under Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, he spoke from the floor about the inadequacy of the number of priests in the Philippines. He said:  To respond to the hunger for the Eucharist, priests say many masses, accept multiple intentions and send lay ministers for the service of the Word with communion.... The faithful know the difference between a bible service and Eucharist, a priest and a lay minister. Many communities wait for the gift of the priesthood and the Eucharist with humility.  To the concept that priestly vocation are a gift from God he countered: \"we should also ask whether the Church is a good steward of the gift.\" He told a news conference that \"The first Sunday after my ordination as a priest, I said nine Masses, and that is regular in the Philippines.\" Discussing priestly celibacy, Cardinal Angelo Scola, the synod moderator, expressed reservations about modifications to the Church's requirement of celibacy for the priesthood. In response, Tagle suggested that the Church should consider such a change to combat the shortage of priests.  At the 2008 International Eucharistic Congress in Quebec, Canada, he delivered a talk on the importance of the Eucharist that, by one report, moved the audience to tears. He contrasted Christian worship with false forms of adoration:  It is sad that those who worship idols sacrifice other people while preserving themselves and their interests. How many factory workers are being denied the right wages for the god of profit? How many women are being sacrificed to the god of domination? How many children are being sacrificed to the god of lust? How many trees, rivers, hills are being sacrificed to the god of \"progress\"? How many poor people are being sacrificed to the god of greed? How many defenseless people are being sacrificed to the god of national security? CANNOTANSWER  Question: Can you provide me with some information on the Bishop of Imus? Answer: In 2001, Tagle was appointed Bishop of Imus on October 22 and consecrated on December 12 after previously serving as parish priest of the Cathedral-parish of Imus. Question: What are some important aspects of it? Answer: To respond to the hunger for the Eucharist, priests say many masses, accept multiple intentions and send lay ministers for the service of the Word with communion.... Question: Was becoming the Bishop of Imus a positive experience for him? Answer: he delivered a talk on the importance of the Eucharist that, by one report, moved the audience to tears.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   PURPOSE To analyze the relationship between an aspect of drinking pattern (i.e., drinking with or without meals) and risk of all-cause and specific-cause mortality.     METHODS The Risk Factors and Life Expectancy Study, is a pooling of a series of epidemiological studies conducted in Italy. Eight-thousand six-hundred and forty-seven men and 6521 women, age 30-59 at baseline, and free of cardiovascular disease, were followed for mortality from all causes, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular, during an average follow-up of 7 years.     RESULTS Drinkers of wine outside meals exhibited higher death rates from all causes, noncardiovascular diseases, and cancer, as compared to drinkers of wine with meals. This association was independent from the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors measured at baseline and the amount of alcohol consumed and seemed to be stronger in women as compared to men.     CONCLUSIONS The present results indicate that drinking patterns may have important health implications, and attention should be given to this aspect of alcohol use and its relationship to health outcomes. The relationship between alcohol consumption and disease has been the focus of intensive scientific investigation (1-9). Most studies to date, however, have limitations. A major drawback is that limited information has been collected regarding the complex issue of alcohol consumption. In many studies, ascertainment of alcohol consumption frequently focused only on quantity of alcohol consumed without considering the many different components of alcohol consumption, particularly drinking pattern (10-12). It has been hypothesized, and preliminary data support the notion, that drinking pattern could have important influences on determining the health effects of alcohol (13,14). The present study examines the relationship between one aspect of drinking pattern (drinking wine outside meals) and mortality in a large cohort of men and women.", "answer": "Drinking pattern and mortality: the Italian Risk Factor and Life Expectancy pooling project."}

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   Background: Mechanisms influencing severity of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children are not established. We aimed to assess the role of inflammatory markers and respiratory viruses in ALRI severity. Methods: Concentrations of interleukin(IL)-33, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST)2, IL-1ß, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-8 and types of respiratory viruses were evaluated in children at the first and fifth days after hospital admission. Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation. Results: Seventy-nine children < 5 years-old were included; 33(41.8%) received mechanical ventilation. No associations between virus type, viral load or co-detections and severity of disease were observed. Detection of IL-33 and sST2 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) on admission were associated with higher risk for mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.89 and RR = 4.57, respectively). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were higher on Day 5 in mechanically ventilated children. IL-6 NPA concentrations decreased from Day 1 to Day 5 in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation. Increase in sST2 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 was associated with longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). Conclusions: An exacerbated local activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis and persistently high sST2 concentrations over time were associated with severity of viral ALRI in children.", "answer": "IL-33 and ST2 as predictors of disease severity in children with viral acute lower respiratory infection"}
{"question": "Article: Spooning peacefully in a double bed, this pair could be any normal couple on a Sunday morning. But revisit the scene an hour later and Jackie Samuel will be curled up in the arms of another man. The 29-year-old is a professional cuddler. She turned to snuggling with strangers to help pay for her studies and provide for her young son. The concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $60 . Snuggle up: Model Jessica Dobson enjoys a cuddle session with Jackie Samuel, costing her $60 an hour . She can make $260 a day and cuddles with up to 30 men a week - including pensioners and war veterans. However, her business 'The Snuggery' has not gone unnoticed and her college has threatened to expel her - while others have called her a prostitute. She said: 'I think I was born knowing how to snuggle. Snuggling is healthy, spiritual and fun. 'I think clients come to me for all different kinds of reasons. Some of my older clients, their wives have passed away, and they just need someone to be with, like someone to experience touch with. 'Some of the younger clients are between relationships, some are in problematic relationships, and some people are just really curious and they come to just find out what it's going to be like.' Jackie advertises her services online and charges $60 an hour. Controversial: The 29-year-old says that she has been called a prostitute over her cuddling service . Paying for intimacy: Customers can snuggle anywhere in Jackie's house but most opt for her large double bed . Novel idea: Jackie started the business to fund her studies and support her young son .

They are banned from touching parts of her body covered by underwear, which she wears under pyjamas. The business has done so well she has even hired another snuggling professional, Colleen. Her apprentice has yet to take on a client by herself but has joined Jackie on two occasions in what they have termed a 'double cuddle'.

One of her repeat customers, who would only give his name as Tim, disagrees with her critics. He said Jackie's cuddles had helped him following a bad break-up and described the sessions as 'meditative'. However, he said he would not continue to see her while in a relationship. 'There's no cheating element, it's not immoral, I just don't think it would be appropriate'. Little spoon: Like Jackie, the Snuggle House staff draw the line at intimate touching .

{"question": "Title: Sam Cooke Background: Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 - December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send Me\", \"Wonderful World\", \"Chain Gang\", and \"Twistin' the Night Away\". Section: Early life and career Passage: Cooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931. In 1957 he added an \"e\" at the end of his name to signify a new start to his life. He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932-2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents.  The family moved to Chicago in 1933. Cooke attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago, the same school that Nat \"King\" Cole had attended a few years earlier. Sam Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. He first became known as lead singer with the Highway QC's when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group.  In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, founded by Harris, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song \"Jesus Gave Me Water\" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs \"Peace in the Valley\", \"How Far Am I from Canaan?\", \"Jesus Paid the Debt\" and \"One More River\", among many others, some of which he wrote. Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of Cooke.

{"question": "Title: Israel Finkelstein Background: Israel Finkelstein (Hebrew: yshrl pynqlshtyyn, born March 29, 1949) is an Israeli archaeologist and academic. He is the Jacob M. Alkow Professor of the Archaeology of Israel in the Bronze and Iron Ages at Tel Aviv University Finkelstein is widely regarded as a leading scholar in the archaeology of the Levant and a foremost applicant of archaeological data in reconstructing biblical history. He is also known for applying the exact and life sciences in archaeological and historical reconstruction. Finkelstein is the excavator of Megiddo - a key site for the study of the Bronze and Iron Ages in the Levant. Section: The Northern Kingdom Passage: Finkelstein dealt with a variety of themes related to the archeology and history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He proposed that the first North Israelite territorial polity emerged in the Gibeon-Bethel plateau in the late Iron I and early Iron IIA. He found archaeological evidence for this in the system of fortified sites, such as Tell en-Nasbeh, Khirbet ed-Dawwara, et-Tell (\"Ai\") and Gibeon. Historical evidence for the existence of this polity can be found in the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshoqn I in this region in the middle-to-second half of the 10th century BCE. According to Finkelstein, positive memories in the Bible of the House of Saul, which originated from the North, represent this early Israelite entity. He suggested that this north Israelite polity ruled over much of the territory of the highlands, that it presented a threat to the interests of Egypt of the 22nd Dynasty in Canaan, and that it was taken over during the campaign of Sheshonq I.  Finkelstein proposed that in its early days, the Northern Kingdom (Jeroboam I and his successors) ruled over the Samaria Highlands, the western slopes of the Gilead and the area of the Jezreel Valley. The expansion of Israel further to the north came during the days of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE, and even more so in the time of Jeroboam II in the first half of the 8th century BCE. Finkelstein described the special features of \"Omride Architecture\" and, with his Megiddo team, dealt with different subjects related to the material culture of the Northern Kingdom, such as metallurgy and cult practices.  Finkelstein also reflected on biblical traditions related to the Northern Kingdom, such as the Jacob cycle in Genesis (a study carried out with Thomas Romer), the Exodus tradition, the heroic stories in the Book of Judges and remnants of royal traditions in the Books of Samuel and Kings. He suggested that these North Israelite traditions were first committed to writing in the days of Jeroboam II (first half of the 8th century BCE), that they were brought to Judah with Israelite refugees after the takeover of Israel by Assyria, and that they were later incorporated into the Judahite-dominated Bible. Finkelstein sees the biblical genre of deploying \"history\" in the service of royal ideology as emerging from Israel (the North) of the 8th century BCE. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What did he do in The Northern Kingodm Answer: Finkelstein dealt with a variety of themes related to the archeology and history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

As a classical soprano, she has performed in staged operas with the Houston Grand Opera and the Los Angeles Opera and in concerts with symphony orchestras like the Berlin Philharmonic and New York Philharmonic. Section: Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill Passage: McDonald played Billie Holiday on Broadway in the play Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill in a limited engagement that ended on August 10, 2014. After previews that began on March 25, 2014, the play opened at the Circle in the Square Theatre on April 13, 2014. Of the play, McDonald said in an interview:  It's about a woman trying to get through a concert performance, which I know something about, and she's doing it at a time when her liver was pickled and she was still doing heroin regularly...I might have been a little judgmental about Billie Holiday early on in my life, but what I've come to admire most about her - and what is fascinating in this show - is that there is never any self-pity. She's almost laughing at how horrible her life has been. I don't think she sees herself as a victim. And she feels an incredible connection to her music - she can't sing a song if she doesn't have some emotional connection to it, which I really understand.  McDonald won the Tony Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play for this role, making her the first person to earn six Tony Award wins for acting (not counting honorary awards) and the first person to win a Tony Award in all four acting categories. In her acceptance speech, \"she thanked her parents for encouraging her to pursue her interests as a child.\" She also thanked the \"strong and brave and courageous\" African-American women who came before her, saying in part, \"I am standing on Lena Horne's shoulders. I am standing on Maya Angelou's shoulders. I am standing on Diahann Carroll and Ruby Dee, and most of all, Billie Holiday. You deserved so much more than you were given when you were on this planet. This is for you, Billie.\"  This performance was filmed at Cafe Brasil in New Orleans and broadcast on HBO on March 12, 2016. McDonald received a 2016 Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her role in the broadcast.

{"question": "Title: Bill James Background: James was born in Holton, Kansas; his mother, died in 1954 when he was five. His father was a janitor and a handyman. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. Section: The Bill James Baseball Abstracts Passage: An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the United States Army in his mid-twenties. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the Stokely-Van Camp's pork and beans cannery. Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (e.g., \"Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?\"), and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful, and witty style that offered an answer.  Editors considered James's pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James began self-publishing an annual book titled The Bill James Baseball Abstract beginning in 1977. The first edition, titled 1977 Baseball Abstract: Featuring 18 categories of statistical information that you just can't find anywhere else, presented 68 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James's study of box scores from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in The Sporting News. Seventy-five people purchased the booklet. The 1978 edition, subtitled The 2nd annual edition of baseball's most informative and imaginative review, sold 250 copies. Beginning in 1979, James wrote an annual preview of the baseball season for Esquire, and continued to do so through 1984.  The first three editions of the Baseball Abstract garnered respect for James's work, including a very favorable review by Daniel Okrent in Sports Illustrated. New annual editions added essays on teams and players. By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.  While writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook's Percentage Baseball, in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James's work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What were the Baseball Abstracts?

{"question": "Title: Joe Sakic Background: Sakic was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, to Marijan and Slavica Sakic (originally Sakic, Croatian pronunciation: [Sakitc]), immigrants from Croatia in what was then Yugoslavia. Growing up in Burnaby, he did not learn to speak English well until kindergarten, having been raised with Croatian as his mother tongue. At the age of four, Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the Vancouver Canucks and Atlanta Flames; after watching the game, Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, he was forced to use skill rather than size to excel, and modeled himself after his idol, Wayne Gretzky. Section: International play Passage: Sakic had an extensive international hockey career, representing Canada at seven international competitions. After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, he went on and helped Canada win the 1988 World Junior Championship. His next tournament was the 1991 World Championships, where Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games. He tried out for the 1991 Canadian Canada Cup team, but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength. Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he was not given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience \"a complete waste of time.\"  Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the 1994 World Championships, where Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team's success. During the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, he played only a minor role in Canada's second-place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games. However, the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.  Sakic's first Olympic appearance came in 1998 at Nagano, Japan, after the event allowed NHL players to compete for the first time. Bothered by a knee injury, he only scored three points in four games, as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished in fourth. Sakic's second Olympic appearance came in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Led by his strong play, the Canadian team played their way to the gold medal match against Team USA, where Sakic had four points and helped the team win its first gold medal in 50 years. He was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists and became one of the first Canadian members of the Triple Gold Club. Sakic also played a part in Canada's triumph in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, where he scored six points in six games.  On December 21, 2005, Sakic was named captain of Team Canada for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Once again, Team Canada was heavily favored and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall. Sakic finished the tournament with three points. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what was international play? Answer: Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the 1994 World Championships, Question: did he win any awards? Answer: Led by his strong play, the Canadian team played their way to the gold medal match against Team USA, Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?

{"question": "Title: Michelle Phillips Background: Phillips was born Holly Michelle Gilliam in Long Beach, California, the second child of Joyce Leon (nee Poole), an accountant, and Gardner Burnett Gilliam, a merchant mariner. She has one older sister. Phillips's mother died of a brain aneurysm when Michelle was five years old. Between the ages of six and twelve, Phillips was raised in Mexico City, Mexico, where her father was studying sociology on the GI Bill at Mexico City College. Section: 1977-1986: Solo album; film Passage: In 1977, Phillips released her first and only solo album, Victim of Romance, produced by Jack Nitzsche for A&M Records. Commenting on the record, she said: \"I didn't do it earlier because I never felt secure enough as a vocalist. I'm good, but Cass was always better.\" Phillips also commented on her involvement in its production, saying that she had been involved in \"every aspect, from mixing to putting together the package and cover myself.\" Her first two solo singles from the album failed to make the U.S. music charts.  The same year, she sang backup vocals with former stepdaughter Mackenzie Phillips on Zulu Warrior, for her ex-husband's second solo album, Pay Pack & Follow. The same year, she starred as Rudolph Valentino's second wife Natacha Rambova in Ken Russell's film Valentino (1977). The film received mixed reviews, with Time Out London saying: \"Structured as a series of flashbacks from Valentino's funeral to his early years in America, the first hour or so of this biopic is Russell's sanest and most controlled work in several years, despite its hollow cynicism.\"  In 1979, she appeared in the film adaptation of the Sidney Sheldon novel Bloodline (1979), a thriller starring Audrey Hepburn and Ben Gazzara. Released in June 1979, Bloodline received negative reviews from critics, and Phillips's performance (along with those of James Mason and Maurice Ronet) was criticized by Variety as being \"drab.\" The same year, she recorded the song Forever for the movie soundtrack of California Dreaming the same year, a surf film that had nothing to do with her former group.  Her other film credits during this period include roles in The Man with Bogart's Face (1980), Savage Harvest (1981) and American Anthem (1986). On television, Phillips played the mermaid princess Nyah in three episodes of Fantasy Island, and Leora Van Treas in Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All starring Stacy Keach in the title role, and appeared in TV miniseries such as Aspen (1977) and The French Atlantic Affair (1979). She has made guest appearances on series such as Spin City and Star Trek: The Next Generation (where she appeared in the episode We'll Always Have Paris as a former love-interest of Jean-Luc Picard).

The title character is a parody of tokusatsu superheroes and is trying to save his girlfriend, who has been trapped in \"Movieland\" by a group of supervillains known as Jadow. To complete his quest, Joe must use his Viewtiful Effects Powers, which are based on camera tricks and special effects used in films. These include \"Slow\", which simulates bullet time; \"Mach Speed\", allowing Joe to attack all enemies with his afterimages; and \"Zoom In\", which triggers a camera close-up and unlocks special attacks. Internally, Capcom treated the game as a \"staff-focused project\" with the goal of increasing the skills of director Hideki Kamiya. The game achieved a Metacritic score of 93 and won GameCube Game of the Year awards from numerous publications including IGN, GMR, and USA Today. The game sold out its initial shipment of 100,000 to achieve a lifetime total of 275,000 units. Producer Atsushi Inaba considered the game a success, achieving his goals of training staff, keeping a small budget, and selling well. However, these numbers were lower than Capcom expected, prompting the publisher to port Viewtiful Joe to PlayStation 2 in 2004, with expanded features. This version sold 46,000 copies with a slightly lower Metacritic score of 90 owing to the lack of progressive scan and frame rate slowdown generated by the porting process.", "answer": "Producer Atsushi Inaba considered the game a success, achieving his goals of training staff, keeping a small budget, and selling well"}

{"question": "Title: Patrick O'Brian Background: Patrick O'Brian, CBE (12 December 1914 - 2 January 2000), born Richard Patrick Russ, was an English novelist and translator, best known for his Aubrey-Maturin series of sea novels set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, and centred on the friendship of the English naval captain Jack Aubrey and the Irish-Catalan physician Stephen Maturin. The 20-novel series, the first of which is Master and Commander, is known for its well-researched and highly detailed portrayal of early 19th-century life, as well as its authentic and evocative language. A partially finished 21st novel in the series was published posthumously containing facing pages of handwriting and typescript. O'Brian wrote a number of other novels and short stories, most of which were published before he achieved success with the Aubrey-Maturin series. Section: Childhood, early career and marriages Passage: O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, in Chalfont St. Peter, Buckinghamshire, to Charles Russ, an English physician of German descent, and Jessie Russ (nee Goddard), an English woman of Irish descent. The eighth of nine children, O'Brian lost his mother at the age of four, and his biographers describe a fairly isolated childhood, limited by poverty, with sporadic schooling and long intervals at home with his father and stepmother Zoe Center in Lewes, East Sussex. His literary career began in his childhood with the publishing of his earliest works, including several short stories, the book \"Hussein, An Entertainment\", and the short story collection Beasts Royal; the latter two brought him considerable critical praise especially considering his youth. He published his first novel at age 15, Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda Leopard, with help from his father.  In 1934, he underwent a brief period of pilot training with the Royal Air Force, but this was not successful, and he left the RAF. Prior to that, his application to the Royal Navy had been rejected on health grounds. In 1935, he was living in London, where he married his first wife, Elizabeth Jones, in 1936. They had two children. The second was a daughter who suffered from spina bifida; she died in 1942, aged three, in a country village in Sussex. When the child died, O'Brian had already returned to London, where he worked throughout the war.  The details of his work during the Second World War are murky. He worked as an ambulance driver, and he stated that he worked in intelligence. Dean King has claimed that O'Brian was actively involved in intelligence work and perhaps special operations overseas during the war. Indeed, despite his usual extreme reticence about his past, O'Brian wrote in an essay, \"Black, Choleric and Married?\", included in the book Patrick O'Brian: Critical Appreciations and a Bibliography (1994) that: \"Some time after the blitz had died away I joined one of those intelligence organisations that flourished during the War, perpetually changing their initials and competing with one another. Our work had to do with France, and more than that I shall not say, since disclosing methods and stratagems that have deceived the enemy once and that may deceive him again seems to me foolish. After the war we retired to Wales (I say we because my wife and I had driven ambulances and served in intelligence together) where we lived for a while in a high Welsh-speaking valley...\" which confirms in first person the intelligence connection, as well as introducing his wife Mary Wicksteed Tolstoy as a co-worker and fellow intelligence operative. Nikolai Tolstoy, stepson through O'Brian's marriage to Mary Tolstoy, disputes this account, confirming only that O'Brian worked as a volunteer ambulance driver during the Blitz. Doing this work, he met Mary, the separated wife of Russian-born nobleman and lawyer Count Dimitri Tolstoy. They lived together through the latter part of the war and, after both were divorced from their previous spouses, they married in July 1945. The following month he changed his name by deed poll to Patrick O'Brian. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where did Patrick O'Brian spend his childhood? Answer: Lewes, East Sussex.

{"question": "Title: Calgary Stampede Background: The Calgary Stampede is an annual rodeo, exhibition and festival held every July in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The ten-day event, which bills itself as \"The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth\", attracts over one million visitors per year and features one of the world's largest rodeos, a parade, midway, stage shows, concerts, agricultural competitions, chuckwagon racing and First Nations exhibitions. In 2008, the Calgary Stampede was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame. The event's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair. Section: History Passage: The Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west. The society held its first fair two years later, attracting a quarter of the town's 2,000 residents. By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the Elbow River to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather, and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895. The land passed briefly to future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett who sold it to the city. The area was called Victoria Park, after Queen Victoria, and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.  The exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded Dominion Exhibition that year. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent C$145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack. It held a lavish parade as well as rodeo, horse racing, and trick roping competitions as part of the event. The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.  Guy Weadick, an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the \"wild west\" than the shows he was a part of. He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans, but with the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen, Weadick convinced businessmen Pat Burns, George Lane, A. J. McLean, and A. E. Cross to put up $100,000 to guarantee funding for the event. The Big Four, as they came to be known, viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen. The city built a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over 100,000 people attended the six-day event in September 1912 to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada, the United States and Mexico compete for $20,000 in prizes. The event generated $120,000 in revenue and was hailed as a success.  Weadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede, promoting the event across North America. However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event. Businessmen in Winnipeg convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially. A third attempt held in New York State in 1916 suffered the same fate. Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of E. L. Richardson, the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. The two convinced numerous Calgarians, including the Big Four, to back the \"Great Victory Stampede\" in celebration of Canada's soldiers returning from World War I.

{"question": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words.   By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent That is according to a Stormont Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report. The cross-party committee also said \"there are elements of dysfunctionality within the EA\". The committee has recommended that the Department of Education (DE) hold an independent review of the EA to assess its effectiveness. In February 2020, the EA apologised after a damning internal report found a number of failings in its SEN services. The NI Audit Office (NIAO) subsequently questioned if the Education Authority's procedures for pupils with SEN were \"fit for purpose\". 'Systemic problems' The NIAO also found that the 26-week statutory limit for assessment and statementing of children was breached in the vast majority of cases. The assembly's PAC has also now released its report into Special Education Needs (SEN). MLAs on the committee found \"systemic problems\" with provision for children with SEN. They said that DE and the EA had spent £1.3bn on SEN in the past five years, with costs rising every year. More than 67,000 school children have a reported SEN, while 19,200 with the most serious needs have a statement of SEN outlining the support they are to receive in school. The PAC said that while the educational achievements of those children had risen, there were many failings in the way they were supported by the department and the authority. \"PAC remains concerned at the number of children that have been failed and how long these failings have been allowed to continue for,\" their report said. \"In the committee's view there are elements of dysfunctionality within the EA. \"PAC strongly believes that there is a need for an independent, external review of the effectiveness of SEN processes, to help build public confidence.\" The committee said there was an \"absence of reliable information and data in the EA\" which had led to poor performance by the EA. MLAs said that failing needed to be \"addressed urgently\". 'Continually deliver a sub-standard service' \"The committee found that the number of children seeking to access SEN support is not known and as such there is a fundamental piece of work to be undertaken to establish the extent of unmet need,\" they said. \"In the absence of this data, the EA cannot fully understand the demand for the services and identify the gaps in provision.\" The PAC acknowledged that the EA had begun to tackle the delays experienced by children waiting for assessments and statements. \"However, the committee remains deeply concerned and disappointed that children and their families had been failed for many years and the impact this has had,\" the PAC report said. The committee chair, DUP MLA William Humphrey, said that there was a culture within the EA \"that has allowed it to continually deliver a sub-standard service for far too long\". Mr Humphrey said front-line staff often gave \"excellent\" support to children with SEN, but there was a need for \"an independent external review of the effectiveness of SEN processes\" in Northern Ireland.", "answer": "Children with special educational needs 'failed' by Education Authority"}

The president of Tekmart signed the letter on October 27 without making any changes to it and sent it back to Megabyte by first class mail. The next day, having not heard from Tekmart, Megabyte's sales manager contacted the president of Tekmart and informed him that, if Tekmart accepted by the end of the month, it would receive a $1 \\%$ discount in the total price. When Tekmart's president responded that he had already sent the acceptance, the sales manager assured him that the discount would still apply. On October 31, Tekmart received a circular from Dataco offering comparable diskettes for $5 \\%$ less than Megabyte's price. The president of Tekmart immediately faxed a rejection to Megabyte. Megabyte received the rejection immediately but took no action on it. The next day, November 1, Megabyte received the signed contract from Tekmart. What is the status of the agreement between the parties? A. An enforceable contract was formed for $ 9,900$ because Tekmart accepted before October 31 and needed no additional consideration for the oral modification. B. An enforceable contract was formed for $ 10,000$ because the parol evidence rule precludes Tekmart from offering evidence of the telephone conversation. C. An enforceable contract was formed for $ 10,000$ because, even though Tekmart accepted before October 31 , the Statute of Frauds makes the oral modification between the parties unenforceable. D.

Under 100 words is a good title length.   The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, triggered the discovery of a high diversity of coronaviruses in bats. Studies from Europe have shown that coronaviruses circulate in bats in France but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity. In the current study the diversity of coronaviruses circulating in western Europe was extensively explored. Ten alphacoronaviruses in eleven bat species belonging to the Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families and, a SARS-CoV-related Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were identified. The diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses presently reported from western Europe is much higher than previously described and includes a SARS-CoV sister group. This diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species. That said, the identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus, and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location. The observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the same species in Europe and Asia, emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution in this group.", "answer": "SARS-CoV related Betacoronavirus and diverse Alphacoronavirus members found in western old-world ☆"}

Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.  Story: Two sexually active men are currently at the doctor getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Before performing the actual tests, the doctor takes a brief physical examination of the men. The doctor notices that Jake's heart is beating irregularly and his arm appears to have a rash on it. While examining Scully, the doctor takes note of how yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully also reports to the doctor that he has been throwing up lately. After the physical, the doctor has the men both pee into a cup so that he can run a standard STD test for them.  Question: Which man is less likely to have Hepatitis B?", "answer": "Jake."}
{"question": "Title: Reggie Jackson Background: Reginald Martinez Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \"Mr. October\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Section: 1980-81 seasons Passage: In 1980, Jackson batted .300 for the only time in his career, and his 41 home runs tied with Ben Oglivie of the Milwaukee Brewers for the American League lead. However, the Yankees were swept in the ALCS by the Kansas City Royals.  As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract in 1981, Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. After the owner consulted Jackson about signing then-free agent Dave Winfield, Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. Steinbrenner never did (some say never intending to) and Jackson played the season as a free agent. Jackson started slowly with the bat, and when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. When the season resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't finished as a player. He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the Brewers, and the Yankees went on to win the pennant again. However, Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game Two of the 1981 ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, both of which the Yankees won.  Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played the remainder of the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers.  Jackson had faced the Dodgers four straight times in the World Series by 1981. No other player in Major League history has played against the same team more consecutive times in the Fall Classic. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Who did Jackson play for in 80-81? Answer: As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract in 1981, Question: What happened during that last year with the Yankees? Answer: Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. Question: What kind of difficulties? Answer: Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. Steinbrenner never did Question: Did Steinbrenner and Jackson butt heads about anything else? Answer: when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. Question: What was the result of that physical examination? Answer: Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. Question: Did their feud continue? Answer: When the season resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't finished as a player. Question: What was his record that season? Answer: He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the Brewers, Question: Was the tension with Steinbrenner ever resolved? Answer: Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. Question: Are there any other relevant facts from this time period? Answer: Jackson had faced the Dodgers four straight times in the World Series by 1981. No other player in Major League history has played against the same team more consecutive times Question: What is his record against the Dodgers?", "answer": "However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers."}
{"question": "Title: Herbert Sutcliffe Background: Herbert Sutcliffe (24 November 1894 - 22 January 1978) was an English professional cricketer who represented Yorkshire and England as an opening batsman. Apart from one match in 1945, his first-class career spanned the period between the two world wars. His first-class debut was delayed by the First World War until 1919 and his career was effectively terminated in August 1939 when he was called up for military service in the imminent Second World War. He was the first cricketer to score 16 centuries in Test match cricket. Section: Childhood Passage: Herbert Sutcliffe was born in Summerbridge, Nidderdale, West Riding of Yorkshire on 24 November 1894 at his parents' home, a cottage in Gabblegate (now called East View). His parents were Willie and Jane Sutcliffe. Herbert was the second of three sons, his brothers being Arthur and Bob. Willie Sutcliffe, who worked at a sawmill in nearby Dacre Banks, was a keen club cricketer.  When Herbert was still a baby the family moved to Pudsey, where Willie's father was the landlord of the King's Arms. Willie worked in the pub and played cricket for the well-known Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club. He also played rugby football, and an injury sustained during a rugby match led to his premature death in 1898.  Jane Sutcliffe moved the family back to Nidderdale, where they lived in Darley, the boys enrolling at Darley School, and she remarried. Jane developed consumption, and she died in January 1904 at the age of 37, when Herbert was nine. Jane's second husband was a bootmaker called Tom Waller but he was not allowed custody of the brothers who moved back to Pudsey to be cared for by the Sutcliffe family. Willie Sutcliffe had three sisters, Sarah, Carrie and Harriet, who ran a bakery. They became the legal guardians of Arthur, Herbert and Bob, respectively.  As the three aunts were devoted members of the local Congregational Church, the three boys received religious instruction there and Herbert became a lifelong committed Christian. He was a Sunday School teacher as a young man and first came to notice as a cricketer when he played for a church team. The boys lived in the family house which contained the bakery and slept in a loft above the bakehouse itself.  Herbert left school in 1908 when he was 13, and was apprenticed to a boot and shoe company as a \"clicker\" who fastened boot soles to uppers. In 1911, his prowess at cricket earned him an offer of clerical employment in a local textile mill, where he learnt bookkeeping, a skill that served him well when he launched his own business career. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When was he born? Answer: 24 November 1894 Question: Where was he brn? Answer: Summerbridge, Nidderdale, West Riding of Yorkshire Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer: Willie worked in the pub and played cricket for the well-known Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club. Question: Did he have siblings?", "answer": "Herbert was the second of three sons,"}

{"question": "Title: Sherman Alexie Background: Sherman Joseph Alexie, Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist, short story writer, poet, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. Section: Education Passage: In order to better his education, Alexie decided to leave the reservation and attend high school in Reardan, Washington. The school was twenty-two miles off the reservation and Alexie was the only Native American student. He excelled at his studies and became a star player on the basketball team, the Reardan High School Indians. He was elected as class president and participated as a member of the debate team.  His successes in high school won him a scholarship in 1985 to Gonzaga University, a Roman Catholic university in Spokane. Originally, Alexie enrolled in the pre-med program with hopes of becoming a doctor, but found he was squeamish during dissection in his anatomy classes. Alexie switched to law, but found that was not suitable, either. He felt enormous pressure to succeed in college, and consequently, he began drinking heavily to cope with his anxiety. Unhappy with law, Alexie found comfort in literature classes.  In 1987, he dropped out of Gonzaga and enrolled at Washington State University (WSU), where he took a creative writing course taught by Alex Kuo, a respected poet of Chinese-American background. Alexie was at a low point in his life, and Kuo served as a mentor to him. Kuo gave Alexie an anthology entitled Songs of This Earth on Turtle's Back, by Joseph Bruchac. Alexie said this book changed his life as it taught him \"how to connect to non-Native literature in a new way\". He was inspired by reading works of poetry written by Native Americans.  With his new appreciation of poetry, Alexie started working on what was published as his first collection, The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems, published in 1992 through Hanging Loose Press. With that success, Alexie stopped drinking and quit school just three credits short of a degree. However, in 1995, he was awarded a bachelor's degree from Washington State University.

{"question": "Title: Silverchair Background: Silverchair were an Australian rock band, which formed in 1992 as Innocent Criminals in Merewether, Newcastle with the line-up of Ben Gillies on drums, Daniel Johns on vocals and guitars, and Chris Joannou on bass guitar. The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by SBS TV show Nomad and ABC radio station, Triple J. The band were signed by Murmur, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages. During their career, Silverchair won more ARIA Music Awards than any other artist in history with 21 wins from 49 nominations. Section: Diorama (2001-2002) Passage: In June 2001, Silverchair entered a studio in Sydney with producer David Bottrill (Tool, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson) to start work on their fourth album, Diorama. Johns formally assumed the role of a co-producer. The album name means \"a world within a world\". Most tracks came from Johns' new-found method of writing material on a piano, a technique he developed during the band's break after Neon Ballroom.  In order to complete the vision for Diorama, several other musicians contributed to the album, including Van Dyke Parks, who provided orchestral arrangements to \"Tuna in the Brine\", \"Luv Your Life\", and \"Across the Night\". Paul Mac (from Itch-E and Scratch-E) and Jim Moginie (from Midnight Oil) both on piano also collaborated with the band. While recording Diorama, Johns referred to himself as an artist, rather than simply being in a \"rock band\". Upon its release, critics commented that the album was more artistic than previous works.  Early in December, the first single, \"The Greatest View\", was released to Australian radio networks. Its physical release in January 2002 coincided with the band's appearance on the Big Day Out tour. Early in 2002, Johns was diagnosed with reactive arthritis which made it difficult for him to play the guitar and subsequent performances supporting the album's release were cancelled. In March, Diorama was issued and topped the ARIA Albums Chart - it became their fourth number-one album and spent 50 weeks in the top 50.  Five singles were released from the album: \"The Greatest View\", \"Without You\", \"Luv Your Life\", \"Across the Night\", and \"After All These Years\" - \"The Greatest View\" charted highest, reaching No. 3. In October, Silverchair were successful at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, winning five awards including 'Best Rock Album' and 'Best Group', and 'Producer of the Year' for Johns. The band played \"The Greatest View\" at the ceremony: the song was also nominated for 'Best Video'. Two singles (and a related video) were nominated for further ARIA Awards in 2003. Following the 2002 ARIA Awards, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. Johns said it was necessary \"given the fact the band were together for over a decade and yet were only, on average, 23 years old\". From March to June 2003, Silverchair undertook the Across the Night Tour to perform Diorama. Their hometown performance on 19 April was recorded as Live from Faraway Stables for a 2xCD and 2xDVD released in November. After the tour finished in June the group announced an indefinite hiatus.

{"question": "Congress passed a statute providing that if the President deployed more than 1,000 United States Armed Forces personnel in a foreign country where \"combat conditions\" existed, the President was required to return such Armed Forces to the United States within 60 days or formally seek a declaration of war from Congress. The statute further provided that, if Congress failed to declare war within 30 days of the President's request, the President was required to return the Armed Forces to the United States. After several tense incidents, the President ordered 10,000 troops from the Army and Marine Corps to land in Culebra, a Central American republic. The American forces had been fired on and had fired back, and they had continued to receive and inflict casualties. The 60-day period passed, but the President refused to go to Congress to seek a declaration of war, and in a televised address to the nation accused Congress of an unconstitutional attempt to usurp powers denied to it by the Constitution.

{"question": "Title: The Edge Background: David Howell Evans was born at the Barking Maternity Hospital, in the county of Essex in England, on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of Welsh parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans, who originated in Llanelli, a coastal town in South Wales. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and then took a job with the electronics company Plessey. The Edge has an elder brother Richard (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian. Section: Guitar playing Passage: As a guitar player, The Edge has a sound typified by a low-key playing style, a chiming, shimmering sound (thanks in part to the sound of Vox AC30s) that he achieves with extensive use of delay effects and reverb. The repeat delay is often set to a dotted eighth note, and the feedback gain is adjusted until a note played repeats two or three times.  In 1987's The Joshua Tree, The Edge often contributes just a few simple lead lines given depth and richness by an ever-present delay. For example, the introduction to \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is simply a repeated six-note arpeggio, broadened by a modulated delay effect. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as \"expensive\", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible. He said in 1982 of his style,  I like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the Gibson Explorer. It's funny because the bass end of the Explorer was so awful that I used to stay away from the low strings, and a lot of the chords I played were very trebly, on the first four, or even three strings. I discovered that through using this one area of the fretboard I was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way.  His first guitar was an old acoustic guitar that his mother bought him at a local flea market for a few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother Dik Evans both experimented with this instrument. He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \"I suppose the first link in the chain was a visit to the local jumble sale where I purchased a guitar for a pound. That was my first instrument. It was an acoustic guitar and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\" The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the Achtung Baby era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.

{"question": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.   Auctioneers overlooking the sale in Colwyn Bay said it showed that Sir Kyffin remained one of the best loved and expensive Welsh artists for collectors. One piece up for auction at the Roger Jones sales went for £30,000, which was well above its estimated price. Sir Kyffin died in 2006, aged 88. Auctioneer Ben Rogers Jones said the mood at the sale had been \"buoyant,\" with no sign of interest in Sir Kyffin's work diminishing. \"We were always confident of selling the top lots, if not to buyers in the room then to those at home bidding on the Internet. It was a highly successful sale,\" he said. The prices for the Welsh artist's work have also remained high, matching sales of two pieces of his work in London last year at Christie's. The prize painting on sale in Colwyn Bay was an atmospheric Anglesey coastal view, titled \"Mountains from Beaumaris\". It was estimated to fetch between £18,000 to £25,000, but eventually reached £30,000. A view of Llyn Gwynant in Snowdonia signed by Sir Kyffin was sold for £18,000. Lesser works also found buyers. An oil on canvas of a mountainous landscape with waterfall, painted in about 1960, sold for an above estimate £7,500, as did a watercolour study of Snowdonia mountain tops, titled Pedol yr Wyddfa o Gastell y Gwynt. Sir Kyffin's works appear in many galleries across Britain and a collection is on permanent exhibition in Oriel Ynys Mon in Anglesey.

{"question": "A cascade of $n$ identical independent binary symmetric channels each with raw error probability $p$, and $0<p<1$. What is the capacity of the cascade when $n$ goes to infinity? Relevant Theorem: A Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) is a fundamental concept in information theory that represents a communication channel model for transmitting binary data (0s and 1s) between a sender and a receiver. The term \"symmetric\" refers to the fact that the probability of error is the same for both binary values (0 and 1).  In a BSC, there are two possible input values (0 and 1) and two possible output values (0 and 1). The channel is characterized by a single parameter, the crossover probability (p), which represents the probability that a transmitted bit is flipped (i.e., changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) during transmission. The probability of a bit being transmitted correctly is (1-p).  The BSC model assumes that the errors in the channel are independent and identically distributed, meaning that the probability of an error occurring at any given bit position is the same and does not depend on the values of other bits.  In summary, a Binary Symmetric Channel is a simple model used in information theory to study the transmission of binary data over a noisy communication channel. It is characterized by a single parameter, the crossover probability (p), which represents the probability of a bit being flipped during transmission.", "answer": "0.0"}

{"question": "Title: José Martí Background: Jose Julian Marti Perez (January 28, 1853 - May 19, 1895) was a Cuban National Hero and an important figure in Latin American literature. During his life, he worked as a poet, essayist, journalist, translator, professor, and publisher. He was very politically active, and is considered an important revolutionary philosopher and political theorist. Through his writings and political activity, he became a symbol of Cuba's bid for independence against Spain in the 19th century, and is referred to as the \"Apostle of Cuban Independence.\" Section: Legacy Passage: Marti's dedication to the cause of Cuban independence and his passionate belief in democracy and justice has made him a hero for all Cubans, a symbol of unity, the \"Apostle\", a great leader. His ultimate goal of building a democratic, just, and stable republic in Cuba and his obsession with the practical execution of this goal led him to become the most charismatic leader of the 1895 colonial revolution. His work with the Cuban emigre community, enlisting the support of Cuban workers and socialist leaders to form the Cuban Revolutionary Party, put into motion the Cuban war of independence. His foresight into the future, shown in his warnings against American political interests for Cuba, was confirmed by the swift occupation of Cuba by the United States following the Spanish-American War. His belief in the inseparability of Cuban and Latin American sovereignty and the expression thereof in his writings have contributed to the shape of the modern Latin American Identity. His works are a cornerstone of Latin American and political literature and his prolific contributions to the fields of journalism, poetry, and prose are highly acclaimed.  Marti's writings on the concepts of Cuban nationalism fuelled the 1895 revolution and have continued to inform conflicting visions of the Cuban nation. The Cuban nation-state under Fidel Castro consistently claimed Marti as a crucial inspiration for its Communist revolutionary government. During Castro's regime, the politics and death of Marti were used to justify certain actions of the Cuban state. The Cuban government claimed that Marti had supported a single party system, creating a precedent for an all-powerful communist government. Castro used this explanation throughout the late 20th century to deter Cuban citizens from demanding a multiparty system. The vast amount of writing that Marti produced in his lifetime makes it difficult to determine his exact political ideology, but his major goal was the liberation of Cuba from Spain and the establishment of a democratic republican government. Despite Marti never having supported communism or single party systems, Cuban leaders repeatedly claimed that Marti's Partido Revolucionario Cubano was a \"forerunner of the Communist Party\". Marti's nuanced, often ambivalent positions on the most important issues of his day have led Marxist interpreters to see a class conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as the main theme of his works, while others, namely the Cuban diasporic communities in Miami and elsewhere have identified a liberal-capitalist emphasis. These Cuban exiles still honor Marti as a figure of hope for the Cuban nation in exile and condemn Castro's regime for manipulating his works and creating a \"Castroite Marti\" to justify its \"intolerance and abridgments of human rights\". His writings thus remain a key ideological weapon in the battle over the fate of the Cuban nation.  One further example of his legacy is that his name has been chosen for several institutions or NGOs from various countries, such as Romania, where a public school from Bucharest and the Romanian-Cuban Friendship Association from Targoviste are both named \"Jose Marti\".  A gigantic statue was unveiled on his 123rd birth anniversary and President Raul Castro was present at the ceremony. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What are some of Marti's most significant works? Answer: Marti's dedication to the cause of Cuban independence and his passionate belief in democracy and justice has made him a hero for all Cubans, Question: How did he contribute to Cuban independence? Answer: become the most charismatic leader of the 1895 colonial revolution. Question: Is he remembered for any contributions outside of Cuba?

One of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it.

Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), Section: 2004: Political protest, Jackie O Passage: During 2003, Frenzal Rhomb's McDougall organised Rock Against Howard, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister John Howard's government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard's coalition was re-elected.  In July 2004, radio station 2Day FM presenter Jackie O was to MC at the Bassinthegrass festival in Darwin. Jackie allegedly arrived late, causing Frenzal Rhomb to cut their setlist short by several songs. She attempted to speak with the audience. In protest, McDougall began playing AC/DC's \"Thunderstruck\" over her voice. Jackie was upset that she was unable to finish her announcement to the audience. Whalley later accused her and other music industry personalities of pushing original Australian bands aside to make way for short-term marketable acts such as Australian Idol and Popstars contestants.  Jackie and her co-presenter, Kyle Sandilands, called Whalley on air during their next breakfast show. Whalley apologised for offending Jackie, but stood by his claims regarding the music industry. The conversation became heated as Sandilands told Whalley \"Your songs being played on this network or the Triple M network... it's just not going to happen now\"; to which Whalley argued that Frenzal Rhomb were almost never played on the Austereo network anyway. During the conversation, Sandilands told Whalley that he was bitter and sad. When Whalley pointed out that Sandilands is in a position to promote new Australian music but doesn't, Sandilands countered that Frenzal Rhomb is not played on the network \"because it's pretty much shit\". While Sandilands agreed that shows like Popstars and Australian Idol are interested in making \"a quick buck\", he also asserted that he doesn't \"care about Australian Idol or Popstars\".  Sandilands argued that Whalley should not \"pick fights with people that are female in the Northern Territory\". Sandilands asserted that if he himself were present, \"it would have been on for young and old\". Whalley argued that gender was irrelevant to the issue, and in response to Sandilands' threat of violence asked Jackie if she was aware that her security guard had threatened a band technician with violence. Sandilands said he endorsed the threat of violence. Sandilands argued to Whalley that he has to \"get over it\" when Whalley recommended that radio DJs should promote original Australian music. In reply, Sandilands insinuated that Frenzal Rhomb, and bands in general, suffer from a lack of support because they are not \"putting [their] stuff in front of the right people\".  ABC Television's Media Watch covered the exchange and presenter David Marr raised concerns about the interview: \"Kyle and Jackie O are also part of a new generation of radio thugs\". Patrick Joyce, general manager of Austereo in Sydney, responded to Sandilands' threats of black listing and violence, \"Music content is decided by the programming directors based on research of the market... Austereo does not approve of threats being made to anyone... We have fully canvassed these issues with Kyle\". CANNOTANSWER  Question: what political protest did they participate in?

{"question": "Title: Paul McCartney Background: James Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (nee Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\"Jim\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael. Section: Drugs Passage: McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \"very high\" and \"giggling uncontrollably\". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \"another kind of mind\" in \"Got to Get You into My Life\" specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.  Initially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second \"acid trip\" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, \"It opened my eyes ... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\" He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.  In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney PS1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a PS100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (200 g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: \"cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal ... I don't think ... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.\" In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: \"People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.\" He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.

{"question": "Article: New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the slaying of a 32-year-old man in the Greenwich Village neighborhood early Saturday as a hate crime because the gunman made multiple anti-gay comments, they said. It is at least the fourth violent attack in two weeks believed to be motivated by anti-gay bias, police said. The suspect's anti-gay remarks were noted before the shooting took place, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. The man was seen urinating on the street outside a bar before going inside and making anti-gay comments to the bartender and brandishing a silver handgun. A little after midnight, the gunman and two other companions confronted the victim, Marc Carson, and another man he was with on the street. The suspect reportedly made anti-gay remarks and asked them whether they were \"gay wrestlers,\" Kelly said. Carson and the other man turned toward the taunts, but backed down and kept walking away. They didn't know it, Kelly said, but the suspect followed them. The gunman confronted the two men again, before shooting Carson in the face, police said. Carson was pronounced dead on arrival at Beth Israel Hospital. Around 4 a.m., a police officer, responding to a radio alert of the shooting, came across the alleged gunman and apprehended him. The suspect turned over a silver Taurus .38-caliber six-shot revolver, according to police. Police later identified the suspect as Elliot Morales, 33. Police said the suspect had forged identification and they used facial recognition technology to determine his true identity. Morales faces a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime, authorities said. The identities of the suspect's two companions -- at least one of whom Kelly said left the suspect before the shooting -- are still not known. Kelly said that the killing appeared to be \"a hate crime, a bias crime.\" There were no words that would aggravate the situation, and the victim did not know the perpetrator, he said. According to Kelly, there have been 22 bias-motivated events this year. That's up \"significantly\" from 13 this time last year. On May 10, five men brutally beat two gay men near Madison Square Garden after the couple was denied entry into an after-hours billiards bar, according to Port Authority Police. The victims suffered severe facial injuries. Police were able to arrest two of the five men; the rest fled the scene. On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said. There was another attack on gay men on May 5, outside of Madison Square Garden following a New York Knicks game. One of the victims told CNN affiliate WCBS he believes the attack wasn't an isolated incident. \"There is no words to describe the pain, 'cause this was not an attack on us, this was an attack on all of us,\" he said. Kelly said authorities do not believe the acts are connected, but the investigations are ongoing. \"It's not a pattern,\" he said, \"but something that concerns us.\" Suspect in burnings of Jewish scrolls charged with hate crimes .

Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes).   Context: Attwater's prairie chicken (\"Tympanuchus cupido attwateri\") is a highly endangered subspecies of the greater prairie chicken that is native to coastal Texas and Louisiana in the United States., The Galliformes are an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \"gallus\", Latin for \"cock\" or \"rooster\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \"Wildfowl\" or just \"fowl\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islandsunless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans., The chicken (\"Gallus gallus domesticus\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs., Grouse are a group of birds from the order Galliformes, in the family Phasianidae. Grouse are frequently assigned to the subfamily Tetraoninae (sometimes Tetraonidae), a classification supported by mitochondrial DNA sequence studies, and applied by the American Ornithologists' Union, ITIS, and others. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, from pine forests to moorland and mountainside, from 83°N (rock ptarmigan in northern Greenland) to 28°N (Attwater's prairie chicken in Texas)., The Phasianidae are a family of heavy, groundliving birds which includes pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae., Tetrao is a genus of birds in the grouse subfamily. The genus name is derived from the Latin name of a gamebird, probably the black grouse., Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast., Falcipennis is a genus of birds in the grouse family that comprises three very similar species : Siberian grouse , Falcipennis falcipennis Spruce grouse , Falcipennis canadensis Franklin 's grouse , Falcipennis franklinii Both inhabit northern coniferous forests and live on conifer needles during the winter . Both have breeding systems with dispersed male territories , intermediate between the leks of some grouse and the monogamy of others ., The rock ptarmigan (') is a medium-sized gamebird in the grouse family.

{"question": "Title: James Traficant Background: James Anthony Traficant Jr. (May 8, 1941 - September 27, 2014) was a Democratic, and later independent, politician and member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio. He represented the 17th Congressional District, which centered on his hometown of Youngstown and included parts of three counties in northeast Ohio's Mahoning Valley. He was expelled from the House after being convicted of taking bribes, filing false tax returns, racketeering and forcing his aides to perform chores at his farm in Ohio and houseboat in Washington, D.C. Section: U.S. House of Representatives Passage: In the House, Traficant was known for his flamboyant and eccentric style. He often dressed poorly, with narrow neckties (then out of style), wide-lapel sport-coats and an occasional denim suit. He also sported an unkempt pompadour, which he jokingly claimed he cut with a weed whacker (it was revealed, after his conviction, that he wore a toupee). His trademark closing lines while addressing the House were \"Beam me up...\" and \"I yield back the fact...\" His website featured a picture of him swinging a two-by-four with the words \"Bangin' away in D.C.\"  While in Congress, Traficant was a supporter of immigration reduction, and a strong opponent of illegal immigration. In the controversy surrounding the defeat of Congressman Bob Dornan (R-CA) by Democrat Loretta Sanchez, Traficant was the only Democratic member of Congress who advocated a new election, due to Dornan's allegations of voting in that race by undocumented immigrants (the allegations went unproven, and a new election was not held).  Traficant's major legislative accomplishment in the House was the adoption of some of his proposals to constrain enforcement activities by the Internal Revenue Service against delinquent taxpayers.  After the Republicans took control of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On the issue of abortion, Traficant voted with the position of the National Right to Life Committee 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. After he voted for Republican Dennis Hastert for Speaker of the House in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because the Republicans did not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century--outside the top leadership--to lack a single committee assignment. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Can you provide me with a little more informaton on the U.S. House of Representatives? Answer: \"  While in Congress, Traficant was a supporter of immigration reduction, and a strong opponent of illegal immigration.

{"question": "Title: Chapter 27 Background: Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical drama film depicting the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. Section: Casting Passage: The script took Schaefer four years to write, but when it was finished, the film came together quickly. With the help of producers Alexandra Milchan and Robert Salerno, Schaefer cast Jared Leto as Mark David Chapman. For his role, Leto gained 67 pounds (30 kg) by drinking microwaved pints of ice cream mixed with soy sauce and olive oil every night. Gaining the weight, he said, was tougher than dieting himself into skeletal shape for his role as drug addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream (2000). The abruptness of Leto's weight gain gave him gout. He had to use a wheelchair due to the stress of the sudden increase in weight put on his body.  After the shooting of the film, Leto quickly went on a liquid diet. He explained, \"I've been fasting ever since. I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days.\" Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. \"It took about a year to get back to a place that felt semi-normal,\" he said; \"I don't know if I'll ever be back to the place I was physically. I'd never do it again; it definitely gave me some problems.\"  Twenty-two years prior to this film's production, actor Mark Lindsay Chapman, while professionally using the name Mark Lindsay, had been almost cast as John Lennon in the biopic John and Yoko: A Love Story (1985). Yoko Ono had been deeply involved in the production and had herself been initially impressed with his audition and approved his casting prior to discovering his full name was Mark Lindsay Chapman. She then nixed his casting on the grounds it was \"bad karma\", and a great deal of press attention was given to his having almost gotten the role. The director of Chapter 27, Jarrett Schaefer, auditioned many Lennon impersonators, but was especially impressed with Mark Lindsay Chapman's tape because he conveyed the \"tough town\" street-smart quality of Lennon that the impersonators failed to convey, as they always played Lennon as larger-than-life. Schaefer described Lennon as having a \"chip on his shoulder and always cracking these cynical one-liners\", and felt that actor Chapman was best at conveying this quality. Schaefer had some difficulty negotiating the casting with the film's producers because of Chapman's name. After Chapman was cast, he asked Chapman how he should be billed to which Chapman replied \"Mark fucking Lindsay Chapman. That's my fucking name.\" Schaefer remarks that this was so reflective of how Lennon talked, it just reinforced his sense that Chapman was right for the part. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Who was apart of the casting for the movie? Answer: With the help of producers Alexandra Milchan and Robert Salerno, Schaefer cast Jared Leto as Mark David Chapman. Question: During filming what was some obstacles if any? Answer: Gaining the weight, he said, was tougher than dieting himself into skeletal shape for his role as drug addict Question: Who had to gain weight? Answer: Jared Leto as Mark David Chapman. Question: Did he feel emotions about having to gain weight? Answer: he said, was tougher than dieting himself into skeletal shape Question: Did he loose the weight after the filming was done? Answer: The abruptness of Leto's weight gain gave him gout. Question: Was there other famous actors that was apart of the movie? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: What year was the casting?", "answer": "2000"}

A furious woman attacked her boyfriend with a club then left him for dead in a shallow grave in their garden last week. After 17 hours underground, the man escaped and asked for help - but when he reported the crime to police, they arrested him on an outstanding warrant for attempted murder. He is now in custody awaiting trial, while his girlfriend is on the run. Josi Roberto Pereira, 37, and Graciele Tomaz, 25, had a blazing row on Sunday evening at their home in Marilac in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, according to police. Grave: This is where Josi Roberto Pereira was buried alive by his girlfriend Graciele Tomaz in Marilac, Brazil . After Pereira fell asleep, Tomaz started beating him with a club, then tied him up with bedsheets and buried him in a 1m-deep grave. He was shocked to wake up and find he was surrounded by soil, but because his girlfriend had left part of his face uncovered he was still able to breathe. Tomaz, his girlfriend of three years, had also apparently stolen a mobile phone and the equivalent of £65 in cash from him. Pereira visited his local police station to report the crime, but when police ran his name through the computer they discovered a 14-year-old warrant for his arrest. He was promptly arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The victim-turned-suspect later took the police to the grave in his garden and demonstrated how he had managed to escape his plight. Sergeant Paulo Cezar da Silva said: 'Because she is a very strong woman, it is possible she acted alone in hitting him and digging the grave. But we are awaiting the results of the investigation.' Another policeman, Gilberto Oliveira, said the situation was highly unusual. 'I know of other cases where people have filed a complaint with police and we have found they have an outstanding arrest warrant,' he said. 'But I've never seen someone buried alive by a woman before.' Pereira's mother Conceigco Maria Romano de Jesus Pereira said the couple often fought, adding: ' I can't believe such a thing happened. 'I'm just so glad he got his face out and managed to breathe. Thank God he survived the blows and then survived when he was buried alive.'

{"question": "Title: Terry Bradshaw Background: Terry Paxton Bradshaw (born September 2, 1948) is a former American football quarterback who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). Since 1994, he has been a TV sports analyst and co-host of Fox NFL Sunday. Bradshaw is also an actor, having participated in many television shows and films, most notably starring in the movie Failure to Launch. He played for 14 seasons with Pittsburgh, won four Super Bowl titles in a six-year period (1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979), becoming the first quarterback to win three and four Super Bowls, and led the Steelers to eight AFC Central championships. Section: After football Passage: In July 1997, Bradshaw served as the presenter when Mike Webster, his center on the Steelers' Super Bowl XIII and XIV title teams, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  In 2006, despite the Steelers being one of the teams playing in the game, Bradshaw did not attend a pregame celebration for past Super Bowl MVP's during Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. According to reports, Bradshaw (along with three time MVP and close friend Joe Montana) requested a US$100,000 guarantee for his appearance in the Super Bowl MVP Parade, and associated appearances. The NFL could not guarantee that they would make that much and refused. A representative for Bradshaw has since denied this report. After an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (February 6, 2006) Bradshaw stated that the reason why he did not attend the MVP parade was that he was spending time with family, that he hates the crowds and the Super Bowl media circus, and also that the only way he would attend a Super Bowl is when Fox is broadcasting the game (it was ABC who broadcast Super Bowl XL), though Bradshaw attended several press conferences in Detroit days earlier. Bradshaw also stated that money was not an issue.  In April 2006, Bradshaw donated his four Super Bowl rings, College Football Hall of Fame ring, Pro Football Hall of Fame ring, Hall of Fame bust, four miniature replica Super Bowl trophies, and a helmet and jersey from one of his Super Bowl victories to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech.  On November 5, 2007, during a nationally televised Monday Night Football game, Bradshaw joined former teammates including Franco Harris and Joe Greene to accept their position on the Pittsburgh Steelers 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.

What did affiliate schools have to let the university see first?, Context: In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.   Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : Me and my now ex had been dating for two years. We hadn’t really done much sexually because we never really had the opportunity to.   However, we have had a few moments of blissful alone time where we could make out and such. After about the third time doing this, I decided to take it a step further and started to finger her. Neither of us had really had sexual interactions before so this was new to us. It was fun while it lasted and we were both satisfied.  One thing I did notice though was that she didn’t also touch me back. I just thought to myself that it was probably because she was nervous seeing as this was her first time in that type of situation.   Fast forward a bit and we’ve had occasions like this a good 3 or 4 times. I finger her, but get nothing in return.  I’d finally had enough and mentioned it to her. I was nice enough about it. Just simply stating it as a fact that she’s never done much for me sexually. And I’m hit with this:  “My stepdad made me give him handjobs when I was younger, so I’m not comfortable touching you.”  Now we had talked about her stepfather in the past and how he had sexually abused her, but that was it. She never told me what exactly happened or how she felt about sex in general due to the experience. Despite me asking a few different times, she refused to answer.   I was annoyed about this and told her that she should have told me this in the first place. And that struck a chord with her.  I just don’t know what to think about this tbh.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "Title: Billy Corgan Background: William Patrick Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and professional wrestling magnate. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Section: 2001-2005: Zwan and solo career Passage: Following a brief stint touring with New Order in the summer , Corgan reunited with Chamberlin to form the band Zwan with Corgan's old friend Matt Sweeney in late 2001. According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says \"is still a work in progress.\" The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin, and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally announcing a breakup in September 2003.  In 2004 Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky \"a mean spirited drug addict,\" and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates' fixation with \"indie cred\" and calling them \"filthy\", opportunistic, and selfish.  On September 17, 2003, Billy first presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago's Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published Blinking with Fists, a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title The Confessions of Billy Corgan.  Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic ChicagoSongs project, which have yet to be released.

The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and they are \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'   CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : I (f18) started living with my best friend (f18) in September. I wasn't looking for a place at the time (was living with my parents) but my best friends older sister was looking for tenants, since she had moved in with her boyfriend and did not want to sell her house. We thought it would be a fun experience and because I'm currently working full time during my gap year I could afford it. Neither of us signed a contract and we gave her the rent money in cash each months, so there's really no record of me living there. We also did not make an agreement on when we were going to move out, but thought it would probably be during Summer, before I would go back to school.   &amp;  Last month I decided I wanted to move back in with my parents. Me and my friend got along fine while living together, but we weren't really having as much fun as we anticipated. I was feeling really insecure about my gap year because I'm working really hard at a job I don't even like, and a lot of that money was paying off my rent while I could be saving up for next year. I missed my parents too. So I told my friend. We talked for about 2 hours and I cried, telling her I just didn't know what to do. She told me she would support no matter what I decide. We agreed to try and live together for a little longer. But the next day I did not feel any different. So I texted her sister, explaining the situation and saying I wanted to move out in March. She pretty much told me no immediately. I texted her back saying this is my decision and I'm willing to pay rent for two more months. Then her texts didnt stop. She texted me from 10am to 6pm. Saying I betrayed their family, that I cant treat people like this. Finally she stopped and her last message was 'You have to pay rent until April, it's only fair because you would live her until July and that way we both pay half'. She says I promised her I would stay till July. What actually happened was: my friend said one week before that she was leaving in July and they asked me if I would be okay with leaving in July too. I said 'I think that would be a good idea cause school starts in September.' Thats all I said.   &amp;  Now, I was pretty upset about all that. When I got home from work that night, my friend had left a written letter telling me she felt like she needed to choose between me and her sister, and that she did not want to do that. Therefore she was staying with her parents for a little while. It made me so sad that she didnt talk to me first. That night I packed my stuff and left.   &amp;  I'm still willing to pay rent until March, which seems generous to me since we have no contract whatsoever and I don't even live there anymore. My friend texted me about a week later, saying she was angry and sad and did not understand me.  We talked and said we would agree to disagree but we havent spoken since. I really miss her and Im starting to doubt myself. Was I wrong for leaving?   &amp;", "answer": "yes"}

My neighbor and I share a backyard since we both rent half of a duplex. She installed a doggy door and her two dogs have full access to the backyard 24/7. My dog is only out under supervision and all poop is picked up as soon as she’s done. My neighbor does not pick up after her dogs and currently has about 20+ piles of dog poop all over the backyard. NOT an over exaggeration.   This is the letter my boyfriend and I wrote to her. We included a peanut putter bar pastry as a peace offer buffer.   We are only writing this letter due to everyone’s work schedule being so different from one another and I hate to be “that neighbor” but could you please be mindful and pick up after your dogs in the backyard? Since we got Eevee, we have been using the backyard on a daily basis. There have been multiple incidents where we, including Eevee, have stepped in your dog’s poop and it has been tracked inside and onto our carpet. We are happy to share the backyard, as Eevee enjoys running around, however, since your dogs have free access to the backyard, it is difficult to catch where they have gone so if you could please keep up with your pups so this does not continue to happen that would be greatly appreciated. If supervising them when they go out is not an option for you, I hope you will consider sectioning off an area for them to go while they are unsupervised so they can still do their business with causing further issue.

A Boston Globe article attributed Barack Obama's win in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election to a marked reduction over the preceding decades in the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing this demographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965. The article quoted Simon Rosenberg, president and founder of the New Democrat Network, as having said that the Act is \"the most important piece of legislation that no one's ever heard of,\" and that it \"set America on a very different demographic course than the previous 300 years.\"Immigrants differ on their political views; however, the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall. Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants, as well as the broader American population. Hispanic evangelicals, for example, are more strongly conservative than non-Hispanic evangelicals. This trend is often similar for Hispanics or others strongly identifying with the Catholic Church, a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage.

{"question": "Title: Dick Williams Background: Richard Hirschfeld Williams (May 7, 1929 - July 7, 2011) was an American left fielder, third baseman, manager, coach and front office consultant in Major League Baseball. Known especially as a hard-driving, sharp-tongued manager from 1967 to 1969 and from 1971 to 1988, he led teams to three American League pennants, one National League pennant, and two World Series triumphs. He is one of seven managers to win pennants in both major leagues, and joined Bill McKechnie in becoming only the second manager to lead three franchises to the Series. He and Lou Piniella are the only managers in history to lead four teams to seasons of 90 or more wins. Section: Final seasons in uniform Passage: When another perennial loser, the Seattle Mariners, lost 19 of their first 28 games in 1986 under Chuck Cottier, Williams came back to the American League West on May 6 for the first time in almost a decade. The Mariners showed some life that season and almost reached .500 the following season. However, Williams' autocratic managing style no longer played with the new generation of ballplayers. Williams was fired on June 8, 1988 with Seattle 23-33 and in sixth place. It would be his last major-league managing job. Williams' career won-loss totals were 1,571 wins and 1,451 losses over 21 seasons.  In 1989, Williams was named manager of the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a league featuring mostly former major league players 35 years of age and older.

{"question": "Title: The Rolling Stones Background: The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1962. The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. Section: Legacy Passage: Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones survived multiple feuds and have gone on to release 30 studio albums, 13 live albums and 109 singles. According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time, with their top single being \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", regarded by many at the time as \"the classic example of rock and roll.\" The Stones have also contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own \"codewords\" and slang, which they have used throughout their catalog of songs, including some of their more popular songs. The band has been viewed as the musical \"vanguard of a major transfusion\" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in both America and Britain. Muddy Waters was quoted as stating that the Rolling Stones and other English bands enhanced the interest of American youth into blues musicians; after they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums - and those of other blues musicians - increased with public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music.  The Rolling Stones have sold over 240 million albums worldwide and have held over 48 tours of varying length. The Stones have also held three of the highest grossing tours of all time, Bridges to Babylon, Voodoo Lounge, and A Bigger Bang. In May 2013, Rolling Stone declared them the \"most definitional band that rock & roll has produced,\" with the Telegraph stating that Mick Jagger was \"the Rolling Stone who changed music\". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the \"whole business model of popular music.\"  The band has received - and been nominated for - multiple awards during their 55 years as a band; including three Grammy awards (and 12 nominations), the Juno award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, U.K.'s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album Blue & Lonesome, and NME awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary Crossfire Hurricane.

{"question": "Article: (CNN) -- The water had barely dried on the rain-soaked stages of Lollapalooza in Chicago Saturday night when festival founder Perry Farrell announced the franchise would be expanding to the Middle East next year. Lollapalooza Israel will take place August 20-22, 2013, in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park, making it the first large-scale global music event in the country. Israel marks the third international location for Lollapalooza, which expanded to Chile in 2011 and Brazil earlier this year. \"It's like an oak seed,\" Farrell explained to CNN. \"You look at it and go, 'What's the potential of that thing?' Put it in the ground and it starts to sprout it, and it keeps growing, and more and more branches grow out of it.\" The three-day festival in Israel's second most populous city is scheduled for mid-week -- on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- steering clear of Friday, the Jewish Sabbath, when Orthodox observers abstain from driving, using modern technology and listening to music. \"I don't think it would be great to do it on a Friday night. No one would go,\" said Farrell. The 53-year-old musician played Tel Aviv with his band, Jane's Addiction, last September, and if he has his way, Lollapalooza will also put its imprint on another city in Israel. \"We got a call from Jerusalem, the Holy City, and they want Lollapalooza to be there, too,\" he confided. \"But it's going to start in Tel Aviv, and we're going to do something in Jerusalem. The mayor's like, 'We want to bring young people, we want to change the perception of Jerusalem.' So we're even talking with them about it.\" As for the next location on Lolla's wish list, Farrell refused to tip his hand. \"I can't tell you, but make no mistake. I want to have a beautiful portfolio of Lollapaloozas to give to my children,\" he said with a smile.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in autoimmunity, but how they are generated and their roles in sterile inflammation remain unclear. Ribonucleoprotein immune complexes (RNP ICs), inducers of NETosis, require mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) for maximal NET stimulation. After RNP IC stimulation of neutrophils, mitochondria become hypopolarized and translocate to the cell surface. Extracellular release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA is proinflammatory in vitro, and when this DNA is injected into mice, it stimulates type I interferon (IFN) signaling through a pathway dependent on the DNA sensor STING. Mitochondrial ROS are also necessary for spontaneous NETosis of low-density granulocytes from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus. This was also observed in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease, who lack NADPH oxidase activity but still develop autoimmunity and type I IFN signatures. Mitochondrial ROS inhibition in vivo reduces disease severity and type I IFN responses in a mouse model of lupus. Together, these findings highlight a role for mitochondria in the generation not only of NETs but also of pro-inflammatory oxidized mitochondrial DNA in autoimmune diseases.", "answer": "Neutrophil extracellular traps enriched in oxidized mitochondrial DNA are interferogenic and contribute to lupus-like disease"}

{"question": "Title: Edge (wrestler) Background: Copeland was born in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. Copeland has stated that he has never met, nor ever seen a picture of, his father. He became interested in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. Section: World championship pursuits (2004-2005) Passage: Edge was placed on the Raw brand in the 2004 WWE draft lottery after WrestleMania XX and returned to in-ring action shortly after the event. At Backlash, Edge defeated Kane, and on the April 19, 2004 episode of Raw, he and World Heavyweight Champion Chris Benoit won the World Tag Team Championship. They continued a close partnership even after losing the title; at Bad Blood, Edge and Benoit defeated La Resistance in a Tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship by disqualification but didn't win the titles. The team disbanded when Edge won the Intercontinental Championship at Vengeance defeating Randy Orton, thus becoming a five time Intercontinental Champion. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Chris Jericho and Batista in a Triple threat match to retain the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Following a legitimate groin injury in a non-televised match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff stripped Edge of the Intercontinental title.  Upon his return, Edge began to show some heel characteristics centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned his partner (although Benoit managed to win the title on his own) and instead interfered in the main event, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again and sitting in a chair and watching the match. After the conclusion of the match, Edge attacked Benoit, officially turning heel for the first time since 2001. Edge then adopted a drastically different gimmick, becoming a crazed and brash villain in the process. At Survivor Series, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista and Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho before getting eliminated by Randy Orton.  On the November 29 episode of Raw, both Edge and Benoit competed in a number one contender's battle royal, but they eliminated each other simultaneously at the conclusion of the match, resulting in a draw. As a result, Triple H was forced to defend the title in a triple threat match. In the match, Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Edge, who shifted his weight putting Benoit's shoulders on the mat for a pin. This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge, as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge. As a result, the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on Raw. In January 2005, Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Shawn Michaels (acting as special guest referee) performed a superkick on Edge, in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge, causing Edge to be the first eliminated. This led to a match at the Royal Rumble later in the month, in which Edge defeated Michaels. CANNOTANSWER  Question: when Edge was born?

{"question": "Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.

Context: Different antiangiogenic approaches have been proposed in cancer treatment where therapeutic efficacy has been shown with the addition of cytotoxic agents. Here, we used SU6668, a small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to investigate the combinatorial effect with paclitaxel on the cellular populations of the developing vasculature.', 'The effect of this combination was evaluated in vitro in a 72-hour proliferation assay on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells derived from lungs, endothelial cells, aortic smooth muscle cells, and human ovarian carcinoma cells sensitive (1A9) and resistant (1A9-PTX22) to paclitaxel. Combination data were assessed by isobologram analysis. Cell survival was determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling and Annexin V staining. The activity of the combination in vivo was evaluated in fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs s.c. implanted in mice. The 1A9-PTX22, paclitaxel-resistant xenograft model was used to evaluate tumor response.', 'Combination index values and isobologram analysis showed synergy in inhibition of proliferation of HUVEC, human microvascular endothelial cells derived from lungs, and aortic smooth muscle cells. The combination induced greater apoptosis in HUVEC than the single agents. The addition of paclitaxel to the treatment with SU6668 significantly decreased the hemoglobin content and the number of CD31-positive vessels in Matrigel plugs in vivo. The combination of the drugs was more active than either single agent against 1A9-PTX22 xenografts; the tumor growth delay was accompanied by a significant reduction of vascular density.\\Question: Is the vascular targeting property of paclitaxel enhanced by SU6668 , a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , causing apoptosis of endothelial cells and inhibition of angiogenesis?", "answer": "These findings show that the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors on vascular cells could be potentiated when administered in combination with chemotherapeutic agents that themselves have vascular targeting properties."}

First off, I'd like to apologize for possible bad grammar, for I am on mobile.  My birthday was a couple weeks ago and I was allowed to throw a party for the first time since I was 10. My parents put a 10 person limit on attendees; I thought it was fine since I don't have many friends anyway.  However, while inviting my friend, Zafrin, a girl we'll call A heard and thought she had been invited. I didn't want to be rude, so I didn't correct her. I just simply told my parents that an extra person would come and they didn't seem to mind.   Some background information, A is the richest girl I know and the most spoiled. Her house is double the size of mine and she buys 2 lunches everyday along with the one she packs. She also loves the fact that she is in higher math class than me despite me not wanting to go higher math class and having the grades to. One memorable quote is when I tried to help her on homework she looked confused on, she told me \"The math is a little too complicated for you, I doubt you'll get any answers right.\" I found out later I was right on most the questions. Despite her spoiled lifestyle, her mom won't let get her a dog for some reason, so when she met my dog, Tank (he is a black lab who is around 6 feet when he stands) she was excited. She immediately started calling him, \"my doggie\"  which I was kinda annoyed with but wasn't vocal. I recall making a joke, \"You call him your dog when you pick up his vomit.\"   When the other guest arrived we all decided to so bad karaoke ( singing off key to songs we found funny, it's really fun) A wasn't very pleased, she told us that the songs sucked, missing the point of the game. During Mine Diamonds, I realized she had finished her pizza besides her crust. I told her she give it to Tank because if she throws it a way he'll just dig through the trash. At first, she sticks her arm out horizontally making Tank see her. He starts to walk towards her and she then starts walking in circles, making sure he is following. I see this and tell her not to taunt him because he has arthritis and we don't like putting pressure on him for too long. She would do it again until I corrected her, once more and repeat. I thought on the 10th time she understood and stopped taunting him. However within a second she is standing on top of a chair and counting to taunt him. My dog jumps and starts to make yelps in pain. At this point, I was really upset and grabbed the crust from her hands and gave it to Tank. I immediately told her, \"Don't touch my dog and actually listen to me or else  you might hurt him. Is that really too complicated or is math the only thing you can do.\" She immediately looked like she was about to cry; I realized I said I was sorry and it just blurted out.

{"question": "Title: Steel (John Henry Irons) Background: Steel (John Henry Irons), also known as the Man of Steel, is a fictional character, a superhero in the DC Universe. Introduced in 1993 as one of several replacements for the then-deceased Superman, Steel continued to be an independent superhero after his inspiration's resurrection. He received his own ongoing series which saw him move from Metropolis to Washington, D.C. and join the Justice League of America in Grant Morrison's JLA. He later mentored his niece Natasha who became a superheroine herself. Section: Film Passage: In 1997, a feature film was produced based on this version of the character. The film Steel stars professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal in the title role and Judd Nelson as a new villain named Nathaniel Burke. The film was originally designed to be a spin-off of the new Superman film that used the \"Death of Superman\" storyline that first introduced the character in the comics. The project languished in development hell for so long the spinoff moved forward without the film it was to be attached to. The movie (released on August 15) was considered a flop both critically and financially. Steel was produced for an estimated $16,000,000 but grossed $1,686,429 at the box office.  A very young John Henry Irons appears in the animated film Justice League: The New Frontier reading a comic book nearby the gravestone of the \"DC: The New Frontier\" version of John Wilson, also known as John Henry, who is reportedly killed in the film.  John Henry Irons appears in Justice League: Throne of Atlantis, voiced by Khary Payton. He is seen wielding a hammer and is seen defending a colleague from an Atlantean before he is saved by Superman.  An alternate universe version of John Henry Irons appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, voiced again by Khary Payton. He is depicted as a scientist who is a member of LexCorp's \"Project Fair Play.\" John was discussing with the other scientists involved (consisting of Will Magnus, Michael Holt, Karen Beecher, Pat Dugan, Kimiyo Hoshi, Emil Hamilton, Thomas Morrow, and Stephen Shin) before they are all killed by the Metal Men with the exception of Will Magnus (who secretly orchestrated the attack).

{"question": "Title: Irving Thalberg Background: Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 - September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called \"The Boy Wonder\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Good Earth. His films carved out an international market, \"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\" states biographer Roland Flamini. Section: Universal Studios Passage: He found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures' New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio's founder and president, Carl Laemmle. Among Thalberg's duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned $25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle.  Laemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and \"keep an eye on things for me.\" Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he was given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, which impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems.  Thalberg suggested, \"The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.\" Laemmle immediately agreed, \"All right. You're it.\" In shock, Thalberg replied, \"I'm what?\" Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919. At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development.  In describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian David Thomson writes that his new job \"owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.\" He reasons that despite \"Thalberg's youth, modest education, and frail appearance . . . it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.\"  Thalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York. Some film actors, such as Conrad Nagel, did not like the 5-day train trip or the sudden warmth of the California climate. Neither did Marion Davies, who was not used to such \"big wide spaces.\" Samuel Marx, a close friend of Thalberg's from New York, recalled how easily Thalberg adapted to Southern California, often standing outside his doorway during moments of contemplation to enjoy the scenery. \"We were all young,\" said comedian Buster Keaton. \"The air in California was like wine. Our business was also young--and growing like nothing ever seen before.\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was his role at Universal Studios?

Paragraph: Researchers with the UofA Cooperative Extension are moving forward with a multiyear study of the environment and growing practices in the “winter vegetable capital,” the university announced last week. They will be partnering with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, state agriculture officials and local growers. “It’s really rare to see a project like this, to see all three entities working together to solve a problem,” Channah Rock, an environmental science professor with the UofA Cooperative Extension, told The Associated Press. Seven to 10 scientists will be based in Yuma and collect data year-round. They will gather samples of water, sediment and wildlife feces, Rock said. The study is expected to last one to three years. One of the goals is to come back with recommendations for growers or anyone along the production chain, and perhaps inform future practices, Rock said. “The goal is to look at trends over time to tell us a better story about what is and isn’t going on in the environment,” she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the spring 2018 outbreak was responsible for five deaths and made 200 others ill. Health officials ultimately traced the romaine lettuce back to Yuma. FDA investigators said water samples from an irrigation canal in eastern Yuma County tested positive for the same genetic type of E. coli. And a cattle feedlot in the area was identified as a potential source of harmful bacteria. However, nothing definitive turned up at 22 farm fields, and subsequent testing didn’t find the outbreak pathogen again in the canal. The FDA and CDC’s assessments were only a snapshot of a few months, Rock said. The scientists hope with more time, they can shed light on how the water became contaminated to begin with. Produce growers in Arizona and California have since adopted new standards based on the information gleaned from the FDA, including additional water quality testing, increased attention to weather and longer distances from feedlot operations. Claim: UofA scientists to study Yuma lettuce outbreak.", "answer": "University of Arizona scientists are hoping to find more answers about what caused a romaine lettuce outbreak that sickened dozens and put the spotlight on Yuma farmers last year."}

Sent 3: Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. Sent 4: We had to live there.\"Sent 5: Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. Sent 6: But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. Sent 7: After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Sent 8: Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \"Spooky\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Sent 9: Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. Sent 10: After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. Sent 11: The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Sent 12: Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Sent 13: Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Sent 14: Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. Sent 15: He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Sent 16: Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. Sent 17: The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. Sent 18: The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

{"question": "Article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A rare inter-Korean meeting ended prematurely Wednesday with no progress. North Korea told the South to \"go back\" according to Lee Jong-Joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, insisting they would not talk with anyone from the government itself. A delegation of twelve South Korean government officials and businessmen crossed the border into North Korea's Kumgang tourist resort to try to resolve a dispute over South Korean assets there.  The joint project was started in 1998 to boost reconciliation and give North Korea a chance to earn money. Seoul suspended tours in 2008 after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier after walking into an off-limit area. The last discussion at the Mount Kumgang resort was in April 2010 but that did not include government officials.

{"question": "Title: Sly and the Family Stone Background: Sly and the Family Stone was an American band from San Francisco. Active from 1966 to 1983, the band was pivotal in the development of funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic music. The group's core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and included Stone's brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Greg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham. The band was the first major American rock group to have a racially integrated, male and female lineup. Section: Internal problems and a change of direction Passage: With the band's new-found fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham. Epic requested more marketable output. The Black Panther Party demanded that Sly replace Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists and fire manager David Kapralik.  After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his fellow band members became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and PCP. As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went), recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\" / \"Everybody Is a Star\", released in December 1969. \"Thank You\" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970.  In 1970, Sly Stone spent most of his waking hours on drugs. He became erratic and moody, and missed nearly a third of the band's concerts that year. The band did close out the Strawberry Fields Festival near Toronto, Ontario in August but live appearances on television talk shows such as The Mike Douglas Show and The Dick Cavett Show went unpredictably. Meanwhile, Sly hired his streetwise cohorts, Hamp \"Bubba\" Banks and J.B. Brown, as his personal managers; they in turn brought in gangsters such as Edward \"Eddie Chin\" Elliott and Mafioso J.R. Valtrano to be Sly's bodyguards. Sly enlisted these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered his enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff. A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band; in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures. He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson, who only remained with the band for a year before being replaced by Andy Newmark in 1973.  To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material. A Whole New Thing was reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone's most popular recordings were packaged into the band's first Greatest Hits album. Greatest Hits reached number two on the Billboard 200 in 1970.  During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal with Atlantic Records, resulting in his own imprint, Stone Flower Productions. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&B artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&B Top 10 singles by Little Sister: \"You're the One\" and \"Somebody's Watching You\", a cover of a song from Stand!. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister's \"Somebody's Watching You\" is the first popular recording to feature the use of a drum machine for its rhythm track. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what were the internal problems? Answer: there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham. Question: what was the friction based on? Answer: Epic requested more marketable output.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   Recognition of antigen by T cells requires the formation of a specialized junction between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell. This junction is generated by the recruitment and the exclusion of specific proteins from the contact area. The mechanisms that regulate these events are unknown. Here we demonstrate that ligand engagement of the adhesion molecule, CD2, initiates a process of protein segregation, CD2 clustering, and cytoskeletal polarization. Although protein segregation was not dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of CD2, CD2 clustering and cytoskeletal polarization required an interaction of the CD2 cytoplasmic domain with a novel SH3-containing protein. This novel protein, called CD2AP, is likely to facilitate receptor patterning in the contact area by linking specific adhesion receptors to the cytoskeleton.", "answer": "A Novel Adaptor Protein Orchestrates Receptor Patterning and Cytoskeletal Polarity in T-Cell Contacts"}
{"question": "Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review. The preferred titles are under fifteen words.   I've had this mouse for a little over a year now. I didn't want to spend money on a cheaper wireless mouse because most of the cheaper ones around my local stores were too small. I wanted something that would be comfortable to grip in my hand. I saw this mouse for $29.99 and decided to spend a couple of extra bucks to purchase it.  Now, when I first bought the mouse, I had Windows Vista. I had no problem hooking this mouse up on my laptop. I simply plugged in the usb receiver and could instantly use the device without a problem. When I upgraded to Windows 7, I still had no issues using the mouse.  Someone in another review mentioned the side buttons are easy to hit by mistake. This happens to me a lot. While gripping the mouse, my thumb will sometimes hit one of the side buttons, essentially a back button. It frustrates me when I'm on a page reading something and by accident, hit the side mouse back button. Despite this drawback, I really like having the side buttons on the mouse. It makes it very convenient to go back on one or several web pages without constantly hitting the back button on my web browser all of the time.  When it comes to the cursor when using this mouse, it follows my hand movement almost precisely. The mouse is durable enough to remain still so the cursor isn't constantly shaking as I found with several other wireless mice. I've seen some wireless mice being so sensitive, even the slightest bump from my hand will send the cursor flying all over the screen. Fortunately, this doesn't do that.  I also like the rubber grips on the side. Apart from obviously making the mouse easier to hold, it rests more comfortably in my hand.  And the one other drawback I find with this aside from hitting the side buttons easily by mistake is the usb receiver itself. I've seen newer mice have a shorter length for the usb receiver. As you can see from the picture of this mouse amazon provides, the usb receiver sticks right out when plugged in. I've came close so many times knocking this out of the usb port on my computer and damaging both the port and the receiver. Luckily, this hasn't happened yet. I only wished the receiver was a LOT shorter.    Would I recommend this product? Of course! Just be careful not to hit that usb receiver when it's plugged in, though.", "answer": "Love this mouse"}

Passage: The first Armenian Evangelicals in Cyprus came after the arrival of the British in July 1878. As they were not committed, and very few, they quickly became associated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. With the influx of more Protestants, Armenian Evangelicals became affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church as early as 1887. In 1933, the newly formed Cyprus Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church divided its congregations into Armenian and Greek councils. Armenian Evangelicals were granted provisional autonomy from the Reformed Presbyterian Mission in 1954, which was formalised in 1962. In Larnaca, as Armenian Evangelicals dwindled after the inter-communal troubles of 1963-1964, services were no longer held; in Nicosia, the Armenian Evangelical church fell into Turkish-Cypriot control during the 1963-1964 inter-communal troubles and so services were then held at the American Academy chapel until 1973. After nearly 30 years of inactivity, by initiative of Nouvart Kassouni-Panayiotides and Lydia Gulesserian and with the help of Hrayr Jebejian, Executive Secretary of the Bible Society in the Gulf, Armenian Evangelicals were re-organised at the Greek Evangelical church in Larnaca in 2002. Since 2005, when Hrayr Jebejian moved to Cyprus, services are held every few months at the Greek Evangelical church in Nicosia. Also, the Armenian Evangelical Church organizes a few lectures in Nicosia.  Question: How many years did it take from the Armenian Evangelicals being granted provisional autonomy to formal autonomy?  Answer type: Number", "answer": "8."}

Passage: With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

{"question": "In early January 2004 , representatives of MacDougall Corporation, makers of the famous \"MacDougall Dog\" hot dog and related convenience foods sold through thousands of owned and franchised \"MacDougall's\" restaurants, met with representatives of Time Management, Inc. (\"TM\"), a firm specializing in time-and-motion studies of labor intensive industries. After extensive negotiations, it was orally agreed that TM would redesign the food production area of MacDougall's restaurants, including modification of cooking equipment, if necessary, so that, using existing MacDougall's food products, savings in labor costs through reduction in restaurant cooking staffs would result. Lawyers for MacDougall's subsequently drafted a written agreement, sent it to TM, whose lawyers modified the draft, and returned the modified draft to MacDougall's. This modified writing, signed by both parties, stated in its entirety: Provided that at least 2,000 work-hours per restaurant are eliminated, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM within 90 days of installation of new food production systems at MacDougall's restaurants in Richmond a first installment of $1$ million. Upon installation of new food processing systems nationwide, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM a second and final installment of $ 1.5$ million. Nationwide installation must be completed by January 15,2005 . Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing signed by both parties. TM immediately began work on the restructuring of MacDougall's food processing methods. On September 5, 2004, a radical change in the layout of MacDougall's kitchen area and new personnel assignments had been designed, and TM demanded payment of the first installment payment of $ 1$ million. MacDougall Corporation refused, but negotiations conducted between the parties resulted in an oral agreement that MacDougall's would pay $ 750,000$ immediately and then the $ 1.5$ million second installment as originally agreed, after nationwide installation of the new system. The restructured food production system was installed and in operation in all Richmond MacDougall's restaurants on October 1, 2004. Subsequent audits revealed that the new system enabled MacDougall Corporation to eliminate 1,500 work-hours per restaurant, saving the corporation $ 90,000$ in labor costs for all Richmond restaurants. The new system required that MacDougall's increase the length of the famous \"MacDougall Dog\" by three centimeters and that the \"Mother MacDougall Hot Apple Fritters\" be made in a rectangular shape rather than the traditional round form. Nationwide installation of the new system in all MacDougall's restaurants was completed on January 30, 2005. The 1,500 work-hours per restaurant savings to MacDougall Corporation was projected at $ 1.8$ million per year. TM sent a certified letter to the chief executive officer of MacDougall Corporation requesting his certification that the new food production system was in place and operating as promised, and demanding the $ 1.5 \\mathrm{mil}$ lion second installment. The CEO refused to so certify and refused to make any payment, noting in his reply letter that the system had not been installed by January 15,2005 , and that it did not use existing MacDougall's food products, as promised by TM. Assume for the purposes of this question only that TM brings an action for breach of contract against MacDougall Corporation seeking as damages $ 1.5$ million. MacDougall's attempts to introduce the testimony of its chief negotiator describing the oral agreement with TM representatives that the new food processing system would use existing MacDougall's food products. TM objects, arguing that the parol evidence rule bars admission of this testimony. Which of the following is the best argument supporting admission of the testimony? A. The memorandum signed by the parties was not a complete integration of their agreement. B. The parol evidence rule does not bar evidence interpreting a written agreement. C. MacDougall Corporation detrimentally relied on the oral agreement in signing the memorandum. D. The parol evidence rule does not exclude misrepresentations.Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.", "answer": "A"}

{"question": "Title: Violent J Background: Joseph Bruce is a native of Berkley, Michigan. He was the last born of three children. His father, Richard Bruce, stole all of the family's money and left when Bruce was two years old. Joe's mother, Linda, was forced to care for him and his siblings, Robert and Theresa, off the income she made as a janitor. Section: Independent circuit (1990, 1994-2004) Passage: After being released from jail in 1990, Bruce decided to get away from gang life and start a career in professional wrestling. Bruce's friend, Rudy Hill, got him booked in a local wrestling promotion. Rudy had lied to the promoter by telling him that Bruce had been trained at the Chris Adams Wrestling School in Texas. At the event, Bruce met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends. Bruce wrestled as Corporal Darryl Daniels, wearing a U.S. Army uniform that his brother had sent him while in the Gulf War, and had his first match against \"Irish\" Mickey Doyle at Azteca Hall in Southwest Detroit. Training alongside Rob Van Dam, Bruce went on to wrestle for Al Snow, including the event which featured the debut of Van Dam. After a short run in the business, Joe realized his dislike for the backstage politics, and decided to take up a career in music, taking the name Violent J.  Bruce returned to wrestling in the independent circuit in 1994, under the name Hector Hatchet. He competed for Midwest Championship Wrestling throughout the next year, wrestling in between recording sessions and touring. From 1996 to 1998, Bruce was involved in a rivalry with Sewer Dwella in Insane Championship Wrestling. He continued to compete in several independent promotions for the next three years, including IWA Mid-South and NWA Mid American Wrestling.

On October 5, 2002, he and Utsler wrestled in Ring of Honor and defeated Oman Tortuga and Diablo Santiago. Bruce was later made a playable character in both Eidos Interactive's video games Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home and Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood as Violent J.

He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again. Section: James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) Passage: In 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, Swift. Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.  Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF.  James Randi began a series of conferences known as \"The Amazing Meeting\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \"Randi Speaks.\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.  In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics. The film was featured on the PBS Independent Lens series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.  In 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with.

Your job is to determine which sentence(s) from the passage can be used to search for further information needed to answer the question.   Question: How many other books did Sphere Books release the year it released The Intrepid Enchanter? Passage:The Complete Compleat Enchanter is an omnibus collection of five fantasy stories by Ametican authors L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, gathering material previously published in three volumes as The Incomplete Enchanter (1941), The Castle of Iron (1950), and Wall of Serpents (1960), and represents an expansion of the earlier omnibus The Compleat Enchanter, which contained only the material in the first two volumes. The expanded version also differs from the previous omnibus by omitting its afterword, de Camp's essay \"Fletcher and I\". The omnibus is the first edition of the authors' Harold Shea series to be complete in one volume. It has appeared under three different titles. It was first published in the UK in paperback by Sphere Books in 1988 under the title The Intrepid Enchanter and with a foreword by Catherine Crook de Camp. The first US edition appeared under the title The Complete Compleat Enchanter, and replaces the foreword with a preface by David Drake. That edition was published by Baen Books in 1989, and has been reprinted a number of times since.

{"question": "For the function $f(x)=|x|−1$ defined on $[-1,1]$. Does it meet the criteria of Rolle's Theorem? Answer true or false. Relevant Theorem: Rolle's Theorem is a fundamental result in calculus that states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and f(a) = f(b), then there exists at least one point c in the open interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at that point is zero, i.e., f'(c) = 0.  In simpler terms, if a function is continuous and smooth (differentiable) on an interval, and the function has the same value at the endpoints of the interval, then there must be at least one point within the interval where the function has a horizontal tangent (the slope of the tangent is zero).  Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, which states that under similar conditions, there exists a point c in the open interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at that point is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].", "answer": "False"}

{"question": "Title: Y. A. Tittle Background: Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. (October 24, 1926 - October 8, 2017), better known as Y. A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. Section: Famous photo Passage: A photo of a dazed Tittle in the end zone taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is regarded among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season.  Post-Gazette editors declined to publish the photo, looking for \"action shots\" instead, but Berman entered the image into contests where it took on a life of its own, winning a National Headliner Award. The photo was published in the October 2, 1964, issue of Life magazine. It is regarded as having changed the way that photographers look at sports, having shown the power of capturing a moment of reaction. It became one of three photos to hang in the lobby of the National Press Photographers Association headquarters, alongside Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg disaster. A copy now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  After at first having failed to see the appeal of the image, Tittle eventually grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. \"That was the end of the road,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. \"It was the end of my dream. It was over.\" Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What year was the famous photo taken?

{"question": "Suppose that: The 1-year spot rate is 3%; The 2-year spot rate is 4%; and The 3-year spot rate is 5%. What is the price of a 100-par value 3-year bond paying 6% annual coupon payment? Relevant Theorem: Forward Rate in Fixed Income refers to the interest rate on a loan or security that is agreed upon today for a specified period in the future. It is essentially a projection of future interest rates based on current market conditions and expectations. Forward rates are used by investors and financial institutions to manage interest rate risk, hedge against potential fluctuations in interest rates, and to lock in borrowing costs for future financing needs.  In the context of fixed income securities, such as bonds, the forward rate is used to determine the yield on a bond that will be issued at a future date. It is calculated based on the current yield curve, which is a graphical representation of the relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity of different fixed income securities.  The forward rate can be expressed as an agreement between two parties to exchange a fixed amount of principal and interest payments at a specified future date, at an agreed-upon interest rate. This agreement is known as a forward rate agreement (FRA) and is a common financial derivative used in interest rate risk management.  In summary, the forward rate in fixed income is a projection of future interest rates that helps investors and financial institutions manage interest rate risk, hedge against potential rate fluctuations, and lock in borrowing costs for future financing needs. It is an essential tool in fixed income investing and risk management strategies.", "answer": "102.95"}

After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. Section: Film debut and breakthrough (2010-2011) Passage: In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.  Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an \"almost-forgotten\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \"pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart.\" The film earned approximately Rs214 million (US$3.3 million) at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut.  Following Band Baaja Baarat, Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma. He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match. The film co-starred Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma. According to Singh, the title character had various avatars in the film, including a chirpy, entertaining side and a sinister side. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \"Ranveer is, well Ranveer: your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars.\" Commercially, Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned Rs370 million (US$5.7 million) domestically.

Text: so to preface this story, me and 22 of my fraternity brothers go on a bachelor party to cabo san lucas in mexico. most of us are from la where we met at school. anyways, we rage face 3 days straight. i wake up from 3 hours of sleep to start packing on the last day. i can barely get out of bed, can't eat, stomach won't have it. first thing i look for is my passport. not there. fuck.   (disclaimer for non-'muricans: i'm a u.s. citizen. immigration is quite strict back into the states, especially from mexico. it's kind of a cliche how tough the border is to get across.)   my flight leaves at 4:20 pm (ayyyyyyyeeee). it's 10 am. so that gives me about 5 hours to find this passport or get a new one. or become a mexican resident.  proceed to turn the house inside out looking for the passport with help from friends and house keepers. luckily one friend is very fluent in spanish which helps communicate with the locals. after 2 hours of searching, it's on to plan b. get a new passport.  another friends flight was earlier than anyone else's and a u.s. embassy was close to the airport. i was told they can print you a temporary passport there. keep in mind, once i leave the bachelor pad i have no wifi or cellular service. after dropping off the friend, i'm left with a shuttle driver who speaks no english. the friend helped spot me money for the rest of my trip(i only had enough cash left to get to the airport and needed to go to the atm). the driver takes me to the u.s. embassy address. it's closed for a week due to a hurricane that came through recently. luckily, a lady at the front desk of the office buildings speaks english. she graciously helps and gives me a number to a person that can speak to the airline and approve me to fly. at this point, i've racked up about 3 hours with this shuttle driver. he's a trooper and is helping immensely despite the language barrier, but still i can tell he's starting to stressing out. because of the extra trips (airport, embassy, back to airport) the cost had bumped up to $60 more than i had. no biggie, i'll just hit up an atm. he drives me to a grocery store with an atm. account is frozen because i hadn't told my bank i was in mexico. i had pulled out cash in a much less important emergency the night before and it flagged my account. so now i'm stuck in mexico while hungover with no passport, no money, no means of communication, and i owe a guy $60. all i could think in my head was \"be cool, keep on keepin on\". so the homie shuttle driver drives me pro bono to the airport to try and get money or get a phone to call my bank and free the account. after 30 mins of trying, we've exhausted all options. i even offered him to pay with clothes, glasses, etc at this point. he understandably wasn't having it. it was looking grim to say the least. this guy can't go back to work without his money and i'm a useless human being at this point. i thought i was done.    almost on cue my friends walk into the airport! i was literally on the verge of tears from excitement. they promptly help me pay the shuttle drive plus hefty tip. me and the driver bro hugged it out, i proceed to get approved for the flight, and now i'm on the plane writing this. hope you enjoyed, don't be like me. never go full retard kids.", "answer": "lost passport in mexico. friends and mexi-cans help me get back into us"}

{"question": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words.   Mrs Foster's comments follow the use of CS spray at a junior Orange Order parade and masked republicans marching during Easter Rising centenary events. Earlier, the Police Federation urged politicians to \"stop using officers as a political football\". Mrs Foster said the PSNI need to get to the bottom of issues \"causing concern\" but had a \"very difficult job to do\". She added that \"it would be wrong if we weren't able to ask questions of our police service\". \"In return they answer those questions and indeed they are monitored by the [police] ombudsman so I don't think that there is a two-tier policing system, but I think there are concerns out there,\" she said. Mrs Foster said it was important to \"establish the facts\" around the parade on the Ormeau Road in south Belfast on Tuesday. \"I know there have been a number of people who have been making their own assessments of what happened, but I think it's important that we have independence in and around the fact finding process and I understand the ombudsman is now involved in this matter. \" The Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the CS spray incident was a \"source of concern\". \"I saw some of the footage on TV last night and I have to say that I was concerned that a child was affected by CS spray. That has to be a source of concern,\" he said. Ch Supt Chris Noble said police had used CS spray during the junior Orange Order parade after coming under attack by adult band members. The parade's organiser, Noel Liggett, claimed the spray was \"indiscriminately\" used after police confronted the parade. 'Demanding and dangerous' Mr Liggett said the spray caused children to have swollen eyes and lips. The police said two officers received minor injuries during a \"minor disturbance\". A 26-year-old man has been charged with assault. The chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI) Mark Lindsay, said politicians who did not witness Tuesday's parade \"should desist from making inflammatory comments\". He said politicians should \"take a more measured, objective position\". \"Officers deserve to be supported, not condemned for the demanding and dangerous job that they do,\" Mr Lindsay added. \"Politicians who did not witness what happened should desist from making inflammatory comments and instead take a more measured, objective position. \"Stand back and take a long, hard look at what you're saying, as your words can stir up community tensions and lead to street disorder, which we can do well without in the run-up to an assembly election.\" The PFNI represents rank and file officers in Northern Ireland. 'Evidence' Police are investigating three parades commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising in Lurgan, County Armagh; Coalisland, County Tyrone and Ardoyne in Belfast. Unionists complained after masked men paraded through Lurgan on Saturday and marchers wore paramilitary-style uniform in Coalisland on Sunday. \"Unfortunately yet again we had masked men on the streets of Northern Ireland,\" Mrs Foster said \"They used the Easter 1916 occasion to bring out those people. \"The time is long gone when we should be seeing those sorts of images in Northern Ireland and I want those people dealt with and I hope that the police in relation to their evidence gathering have plenty of evidence and they can move forward on that.\" Speaking on the BBC's Talkback programme, UUP politician Rodney McCune said the police in Northern Ireland have a \"difficult job\" and face challenges which other UK forces do not. He said: \"If people are concerned about police conduct, or are not content with the way a matter was dealt with, then they should bring their complaints to the Police Ombudsman.\" He also said he did not believe there was a \"two-tier, political or sectarian\" policing system in Northern Ireland.", "answer": "Arlene Foster: 'No two-tier NI police service'"}

{"question": "Article: Washington (CNN) -- Will an anti-incumbent wave return Republicans to power in the House and Senate, or can Democrats engineer a late rush to hold on to their congressional majorities? The 2010 mid-term elections comes down to campaign basics in the final nine days until vote-counting begins. For now, the two parties agree that Republicans will win more seats than they currently hold, but they differ sharply on how many and whether a major power shift will occur. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" program that an unprecedented GOP wave would win control of both chambers as well as state legislatures in a broad condemnation of President Barack Obama and Democratic policies. \"The voters are tired of the fact that the federal government has not listened to them over the past two years, has moved in its own direction, at its own rhythm and they want to pull back on that,\" Steele said. \"And I think you're going to see a wave, an unprecedented wave on election day that's going to surprise a lot of people.\" His Democratic counterpart, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, pointed to strengthening poll numbers for his party's candidates as a sign that the Democratic base was getting energized. \"From this point forward, it's all about turnout and ground game, and we're seeing good early voting trends,\" said Kaine, the Democratic National Committee chairman, when asked on the ABC program \"This Week\" if Democrats can hold their majorities. \"We've got work to do, but we think we can do it.\" While Kaine said the House remains uncertain, he sounded much more confident about the Senate. \"Four or five months ago, the Republicans thought they had a great chance at taking both houses,\" Kaine said. \"For a variety of reasons, the Senate has gotten much more difficult for them. And again, we're seeing this week strong moves in polling for our Senate candidates\" in several states. One of those reasons is inexperienced, conservative ideologues backed by the Tea Party movement who defeated mainstream Republicans in primary elections and now trail Democratic foes as the November 2 vote approaches. The Delaware race is a prime example. Christine O'Donnell's primary win over nine-term Republican Rep. Mike Castle made a Senate seat once considered likely Republican now an apparent Democratic victory for previously little-known Chris Coons. O'Donnell's campaign became a national joke over a long-ago comment that she once \"dabbled in witchcraft\" and other missteps. It also exposed a rift within the political right between the mainstream Republican establishment, which criticized O'Donnell and other Tea Party backed candidates, and the more conservative Tea Party movement. With the election approaching, Republicans put on a united front Sunday, with GOP strategist Karl Rove -- one of O'Donnell's harshest critics -- calling the Tea Party movement \"patriotic\" and \"incredibly positive.\" While noting that Tea Party backers \"are not people who are skilled in the ways of Washington,\" Rove told the CBS program \"Face the Nation\" he welcomed the movement as a \"wholesome development\" that would greatly increase Republican turnout in a mid-term election. Rove predicted Republicans will win well over 50 House seats to easily grab majority control of the chamber, and that a GOP Senate majority also was possible. On the same program, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland predicted a different outcome, due to voter distrust of what he called special interest money going for anonymous donations to groups running attack ads against Democratic candidates. The issue hammered by Democrats including Obama in recent weeks was proving resonant, Van Hollen said. \"I'm confident the Democrats are going to retain their majority because the American people are connecting the dots between these tens of millions of dollars of secret special interest money,\" he said, later adding: \"The early voting states are showing good news for the Democrats.\" Both Rove and Steele said election disclosure laws should be changed, but added that the anonymous donations to groups running political ads complied with current law. Rove added that Democrats including Obama benefited from similar anonymous campaign funding in the past. Summarize the above article in 3 sentences.", "answer": "Nine days before the vote, both sides predict success . Rove calls Tea Party movement \"wholesome\" and \"positive\" Kaine says Democratic poll numbers are trending up ."}
{"question": "Title: Burt Bacharach Background: Burt Freeman Bacharach ( BAK-@-rak; born May 12, 1928) is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, pianist, and singer who has composed hundreds of popular hit songs from the late 1950s through the 1980s, many in collaboration with popular lyricist Hal David. A six-time Grammy Award winner and three-time Academy Award winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists. As of 2014, he had written 73 US and 52 UK Top 40 hits. He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century popular music. Section: Beginning work as musician Passage: Following his tour of duty in the United States Army, Bacharach spent the next three years as a pianist and conductor for popular singer Vic Damone. Damone recalls: \"Burt was clearly bound to go out on his own. He was an exceptionally talented, classically trained pianist, with very clear ideas on the musicality of songs, how they should be played, and what they should sound like. I appreciated his musical gifts.\" He later worked in similar capacity for various other singers, including Polly Bergen, Steve Lawrence, the Ames Brothers and Paula Stewart (who became his first wife). When he was unable to find better jobs, Bacharach worked at resorts in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where he accompanied singers such as Joel Grey.  In 1956, at age 28, Bacharach's productivity increased when composer Peter Matz recommended him to Marlene Dietrich, who needed an arranger and conductor for her nightclub shows. He then became part-time music director for Dietrich, the German actress and singer who had been an international screen star in the 1930s. They toured worldwide off and on until the early 1960s; when they weren't touring, he wrote songs. As a result of his collaboration with Dietrich, he gained his first major recognition as a conductor and arranger.  In her autobiography, she remembered that Bacharach loved touring in Russia and Poland because the violinists were \"extraordinary,\" and musicians were greatly appreciated by the public. He liked Edinburgh and Paris, along with the Scandinavian countries, and \"he also felt at home in Israel,\" she says, where music was similarly \"much revered.\" Their working relationship ceased by the early 1960s, after about five years with Dietrich, with Bacharach telling her that he wanted to devote his full-time to songwriting. She thought of her time with him as \"seventh heaven ... As a man, he embodied everything a woman could wish for. ... How many such men are there?

{"question": "Title: Graham McKenzie Background: Graham Douglas McKenzie (born 24 June 1941) - commonly called Garth McKenzie after the comic strip hero - is an Australian cricketer who played for Western Australia (1960-74), Leicestershire (1969-75), Transvaal (1979-80) and Australia (1961-71) and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1965. He succeeded Alan Davidson as Australia's premier fast bowler and was in turn succeeded by Dennis Lillee, playing with both at either end of his career. McKenzie was particularly noted for his muscular physique (hence his nickname) and ability to take wickets on good batting tracks. His father Eric McKenzie and uncle Douglas McKenzie played cricket for Western Australia and Garth was chosen for the Ashes tour of England in 1961 aged only 19. Section: International career Passage: The 1960-61 season began with McKenzie's third first-class match, against the West Indies. He did not bowl in the first innings but took 4/41 in the second to seal a 94 run win, prompting West Indies captain Frank Worrell to predict a bright future.  Further strong performances during the Shield season saw him selected at age 19 for the 1961 Ashes tour under Richie Benaud. Following an injury to Benaud, Australia replaced him with a third seamer, allowing McKenzie to make his debut in the Second Test at Lord's during the \"Battle of the Ridge\". In his first innings, he made 34 on his twentieth birthday batting at number 10 on a difficult pitch. The last two wickets added 102 and Australia gained a lead of 134. In England's second innings, McKenzie captured the prized wickets of Ted Dexter and Peter May, and took the last three wickets in twelve balls to give 5/37 on debut. Australia went on to win by five wickets. After losing the Third Test at Headingley, Australia won the fourth Test at Old Trafford with McKenzie again making a valuable contribution with the bat. With a lead of only 177 with nine wickets down in the second innings, McKenzie joined Alan Davidson. He held his end for 32 runs while Davidson's powerful hitting saw 98 added for Australia's highest tenth wicket partnership on English soil. This allowed Benaud to bowl Australia to victory on the final day. The youngest member of the touring party, McKenzie was one of eight bowlers to take at least fifty wickets.  When Dexter's Englishmen toured Australia in 1962-63, McKenzie was promoted to share the new ball with Davidson. Playing in all five Tests, he did not trouble the batsmen to the same extent as his partner, taking 20 wickets for 30.95. He was noted for his ability to contain the opposition by bowling long spells. Davidson retired at the end of the series and McKenzie became the pace spearhead when South Africa toured in 1963-64. He was Australia's leading bowler with 16 wickets at 43.06. In the Third Test in Sydney, he hit his highest Test score of 76. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did McKenzie start his international career? Answer: The 1960-61 season began with McKenzie's third first-class match, against the West Indies. Question: Did he win that match? Answer: He did not bowl in the first innings but took 4/41 in the second to seal a 94 run win, Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer: Further strong performances during the Shield season saw him selected at age 19 for the 1961 Ashes tour under Richie Benaud. Question: How did his international career end?", "answer": "Davidson retired at the end of the series and McKenzie became the pace spearhead when South Africa toured in 1963-64."}

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question.   Background Paragraph: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20].  Story: In 2016, the subtropical ridge across North America migrated far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September, but in 2017 the atmosphere dried out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime. Therefore a wet year was followed buy a dry one, and the fires started again.  Question: Which month of the year was drier, July 2017 or October 2016?", "answer": "July 2017."}

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   Viroporins are small, α-helical, hydrophobic virus encoded proteins, engineered to form homo-oligomeric hydrophilic pores in the host membrane. Viroporins participate in multiple steps of the viral life cycle, from entry to budding. As any other membrane protein, viroporins have to find the way to bury their hydrophobic regions into the lipid bilayer. Once within the membrane, the hydrophobic helices of viroporins interact with each other to form higher ordered structures required to correctly perform their porating activities. This two-step process resembles the two-stage model proposed for membrane protein folding by Engelman and Poppot. In this review we use the membrane protein folding model as a leading thread to analyze the mechanism and forces behind the membrane insertion and folding of viroporins. We start by describing the transmembrane segment architecture of viroporins, including the number and sequence characteristics of their membrane-spanning domains. Next, we connect the differences found among viroporin families to their viral genome organization, and finalize focusing on the pathways used by viroporins in their way to the membrane and on the transmembrane helix-helix interactions required to achieve proper folding and assembly.", "answer": "Viroporins, Examples of the Two-Stage Membrane Protein Folding Model"}
{"question": "In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Your task is to generate answer \"yes\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \"no\".   Review: In Iran, women are not permitted to attend men's sporting events, apparently to \"protect\" them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans (so since men can't restrain or behave themselves, women are forced to suffer. Go figure.). \"Offside\" tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who, dressed like men, attempt to sneak into the high-stakes match between Iran and Bahrain that, in 2005, qualified Iran to go to the World Cup (the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game).\"Offside\" is a slice-of-life comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films (\"The Shop on Main Street,\" \"Loves of a Blonde,\" \"Closely Watched Trains\" etc.) that flowed out of Communist Czechoslovakia as part of the \"Prague Miracle\" in the mid 1960's. As with many of those works, \"Offside\" is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative. Indeed, it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective.Once their ruse is discovered, the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside. Stuck where they are, all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in, guards who are basically bumbling, good-natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service. Even most of the men going into the stadium don't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in. Still the prohibition persists. Yet, how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction? And, yet, the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a \"point.\" They are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and, like all the men in the country, cheer on their team.It's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous, but, in either case, the actors, with their marvelously expressive faces, do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing. Mohammad Kheir-abadi and Shayesteh Irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast. The structure of the film is also very loose and freeform, as writer/director Jafar Panahi and co-writer Shadmehr Rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters, then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others. With this documentary-type approach, we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in \"real time.\" Very often, it's quite easy for us to forget we're actually watching a movie.It was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good-natured humor in the film (it's what the Czech filmmakers did as well), the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign. \"Offside\" is obviously a cry for justice, but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavy-breathing tragedy. Instead, it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience's common humanity. And isn't that what true art is supposed to be all about? In its own quiet, understated way, \"Offside\" is one of the great, under-appreciated gems of 2007. Question: is it a positive review?", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.   Robin Formstone's mother Ada was 88 when she was a patient on Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire in 2013. Her son claims she was bullied and forced to sleep in an ant-infested bed. A report published on Thursday found no institutional abuse at the ward but accepted there had been failings. Betsi Cadwaladr health board has accepted the latest findings on the ward, which was closed in December 2013. The latest investigation, carried out by the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (Hascas), angered relatives of former patients. The report author Dr Androulla Johnstone said family accounts of their relatives' treatment on the ward had \"differed greatly\". \"For example, some families stated that in their view Tawel Fan ward was an abusive environment where their loved ones were mistreated, neglected and came to harm,\" she said. \"Other families offered the view that the care and treatment their loved ones received was of a very good standard with staff showing kindness and compassion throughout their relative's entire episode of care.\" But Mr Formstone, from Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, \"quite clearly\" considers what his mother experienced as abuse. \"One day my mother was complaining that something was biting her,\" the 56-year old said. \"After I took the sheets off her bed I found that the whole bed was infested with ants. \"They said there was no other room to put my mother in and she ended up sleeping in an ant-infested bed for the last three weeks she was in there.\" His mother, who died when she was 93, told him she was being bullied by one of the nurses, but Mr Formstone said staff didn't take his complaints seriously. Mrs Formstone had severe incontinence, but was not cared for with dignity, he added. \"There was more than one occasion where she'd be in the same clothes at least two days lying in her own mess.\" The new report amounted to \"a huge cover-up\", he said. \"All we wanted was the truth of the way our families were treated and it's quite appalling...they just don't want to use the word abuse.\" Responding to the report's findings, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was clear \"we have much more to do to make improvements across all of our adult services - not just mental health services\". Chairman Dr Peter Higson and chief executive Gary Doherty said: \"We fully acknowledge that this has been and will continue to be a very difficult process for all the families and staff involved. \"We accept the report's findings and are establishing a taskforce led by the executive director of nursing and midwifery to build on our existing work programmes to take forward the recommendations, alongside our partners, at pace.\" The health board said several members of staff \"have had some sort of employment restriction placed on them over a period of time. This ranges from suspension, alternative duties and restriction to practice\". \"The HASCAS individual staff specific reports will be used as investigative reports for employment and professional regulation purposes. On receipt of these reports, the Health Board and/or appropriate professional body will take the necessary appropriate action. \"", "answer": "The son of a former patient at a scandal-hit dementia ward has told of the \"abuse\" he believes his mother suffered."}

{"question": "Title: The Dubliners Background: The Dubliners were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962. The band started off as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named in honour of its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves as The Dubliners. The group line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career. However, the group's success was centered on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. Section: Success Passage: The Dubliners became well known, not just in Ireland but also as pioneers for Irish folk in Europe and also (though less successful) in the United States. Their 1967 recordings of \"Seven Drunken Nights\" and \"The Black Velvet Band\" were released on the fledgling Major Minor label, and were heavily promoted on pirate radio station Radio Caroline. The result was that both records reached the top 20 in the UK pop charts. A third single, \"Maids, When You're Young Never Wed an Old Man\" reached number 43 in December 1967. It was their last UK hit single till they recorded with The Pogues in 1987.  In 1974, Ronnie Drew decided to quit the band, to spend more time with his family. He was replaced with Jim McCann. Before joining the band McCann had a TV show in the early seventies called The McCann man. He is best known for his incarnations of \"Carrickfergus\", Makem's \"Four Green Fields\", and \"Lord of the Dance\". He stayed with the band until 1979 when he left to start a solo career; then Ronnie Drew rejoined the band. First Ronnie went to Norway to record two songs in the Norwegian language with the Norwegian band Bergeners.  The Dubliners also gained popularity amongst famous musicians such as Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd's drummer Nick Mason, who were all self-proclaimed Dubliners fans.  In the 1960s, The Dubliners sang rebel songs such as \"The Old Alarm Clock\", \"The Foggy Dew\" and \"Off to Dublin in the Green\". However, the conflict in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards led them to drop most of these from their repertoire. They resumed performing such songs occasionally towards the end of their career. They have also recorded satirical protest songs against nuclear weapons such as The Button Pusher and Protect and Survive, feminist songs such as Don't Get Married, and socialist songs such as Joe Hill.  On 8 February 2012, The Dubliners received a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the 2012 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What are some of the factors of the success of The Dubliners? Answer: The Dubliners sang rebel songs such as \"The Old Alarm Clock\", \"The Foggy Dew\" and \"Off to Dublin in the Green\". Question: Was any of this songs a hit?

Her American-born mother, Judith (nee LeFever), was a writer and special needs tutor, and her French-born father, Gerard Louis-Dreyfus, chaired Louis Dreyfus Energy Services. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Leopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping conglomerate, which members of her family control into the 21st century. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group.

Louis-Dreyfus was subsequently made into a cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1982 to 1985, becoming the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time. During her time on SNL, she appeared alongside several actors who would later rise to prominence, such as Eddie Murphy, Jim Belushi, Billy Crystal, and Martin Short. It was during her third and final year on SNL that she met writer Larry David during his only year on the show, who would later co-create Seinfeld. Louis-Dreyfus has commented that her casting on SNL was a \"Cinderella-getting-to-go-to-the-ball kind of experience\"; however, she has also admitted that at times it was often quite tense, stating that she \"didn't know how to navigate the waters of show business in general and specifically doing a live sketch-comedy show\".  Following her 1985 departure from SNL, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including the Woody Allen-directed Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); Soul Man (1986), starring C. Thomas Howell; and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), in which she starred alongside fellow SNL alum Chevy Chase. In 1987, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot The Art of Being Nick, an intended spin-off from Family Ties starring Scott Valentine. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer Gary David Goldberg for a role on his new sitcom Day by Day, as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift.

{"question": "Title: Freddie King Background: Freddie King (September 3, 1934 - December 28, 1976) was an American blues guitarist and singer. He has been described as one of the \"Three Kings\" of electric blues guitar, along with Albert King and B.B. King. He was an influential guitarist with hits for Federal Records in the early 1960s. His soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar style inspired countless musicians, particularly guitarists (Eric Clapton is a notable example). Section: Biography Passage: According to his birth certificate he was named Fred King, and his parents were Ella Mae King and J. T. Christian. When Freddie was six years old, his mother and his uncle began teaching him to play the guitar. In autumn 1949, he and his family moved from Dallas to the South Side of Chicago.  In 1952 King started working in a steel mill. In the same year he married another Texas native, Jessie Burnett. They had seven children.  Almost as soon as he had moved to Chicago, King started sneaking into South Side nightclubs, where he heard blues performed by Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, T-Bone Walker, Elmore James, and Sonny Boy Williamson. King formed his first band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with the guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson and the drummer Frank \"Sonny\" Scott. In 1952, while employed at a steel mill, the eighteen-year-old King occasionally worked as a sideman with such bands as the Little Sonny Cooper Band and Earl Payton's Blues Cats. In 1953 he recorded with the latter for Parrot Records, but these recordings were never released. As the 1950s progressed, King played with several of Muddy Waters's sidemen and other Chicago mainstays, including the guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Robert Lockwood Jr., Eddie Taylor, and Hound Dog Taylor; the bassist Willie Dixon; the pianist Memphis Slim; and the harmonicist Little Walter.  In 1956 he cut his first record as a leader, for El-Bee Records. The A-side was \"Country Boy\", a duet with Margaret Whitfield. The B-side was a King vocal. Both tracks feature the guitar of Robert Lockwood, Jr., who during these years was also adding rhythm backing and fills to Little Walter's records.  King was repeatedly rejected in auditions for the South Side's Chess Records, the premier blues label, which was the home of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. The complaint was that King sang too much like B.B. King. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the West Side, though. The bassist and producer Willie Dixon, during a period of estrangement from Chess in the late 1950s, asked King to come to Cobra Records for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself as perhaps the biggest musical force on the West Side. He played along with Magic Sam and reputedly played backing guitar, uncredited, on some of Sam's tracks for Mel London's Chief and Age labels, though King does not stand out on them. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where did King grow up? Answer: In autumn 1949, he and his family moved from Dallas to the South Side of Chicago. Question: When was his born? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Where did he attend school? Answer: In 1952 King started working in a steel mill. In the same year he married another Texas native, Jessie Burnett.

A Republican Party member, he was previously Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Rubio is a Cuban American from Miami, with a B.A. from the University of Florida and a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law. In the late 1990s, he was a City Commissioner for West Miami and was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, representing the 111th House district.

Rubio placed second in the Republican primary on December 14, 1999, but won the run-off election for the Republican nomination, defeating Angel Zayon (a television and radio reporter who was popular with Cuban exiles) by just 64 votes.

{"question": "Title: Dorothy Day Background: Dorothy Day, Obl.S.B. (November 8, 1897 - November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist, and Catholic convert. Day initially lived a bohemian lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her conversion. She later became a key figure in the Catholic Worker Movement and earned a national reputation as a political radical, perhaps the most famous radical in American Catholic Church history. Section: Early years Passage: Dorothy Day was born on November 8, 1897, in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. She was born into a family described by one biographer as \"solid, patriotic, and middle class\". Her father, John Day, was a Tennessee native of Irish heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of English ancestry. Her parents were married in an Episcopal church in Greenwich Village. She had three brothers and a sister. In 1904, her father, who was a sports writer devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in San Francisco. The family lived in Oakland, California, until the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed the newspaper's facilities and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake's devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and Christian community. The family relocated to Chicago.  Day's parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten she started to attend Church of Our Saviour, an Episcopal church in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, after its rector convinced her mother to let Day's brothers join the church choir. She was taken with the liturgy and its music. She studied the catechism and was baptized and confirmed in that church in 1911.  Day was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. She worked from one book to another, noting Jack London's mention of Herbert Spencer in Martin Eden, and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from Peter Kropotkin, who promoted a belief in cooperation in contrast to Darwin's competition for survival. She also enjoyed Russian literature in university, especially Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Gorky. Day read a lot of socially conscious work, which gave her a background for her future; it helped bolster her support for and involvement in social activism.  In 1914, Day attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar. Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction. She avoided campus social life and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores. She left the university after two years and moved to New York City. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where was Dorothy Day born? Answer: in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Question: Where did she grow up? Answer: The family lived in Oakland, California, until the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 Question: Where did they move after the San Francisco Earthquake?

{"question": "In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage.   If there isn't dim lighting, what form do chloroplasts take?, Context: The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones. Chloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus-response systems that can be found in plants. Mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move.", "answer": "vertical columns"}
{"question": "Title: Dream Theater Background: Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Section: Black Clouds & Silver Linings (2008-2010) Passage: On October 7, 2008, Dream Theater returned to Avatar Studios to begin work on their tenth album, resuming their relationship with Paul Northfield to engineer and mix the record. The album, entitled Black Clouds & Silver Linings, was released on June 23, 2009. In addition to the standard CD, the album was made available on vinyl LP, as well as a 3-disc Special Edition CD that includes the full album, a CD of instrumental mixes of the album and a CD of six cover songs from artists such as Queen and Rainbow. On July 1, 2009, the album debuted at No. 6 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart, with first week sales totalling 40,285, making their highest entry on the chart. The album featured \"The Shattered Fortress\", the last in Mike Portnoy's series of songs about his 12-step recovery from alcoholism, as well as the song \"The Best of Times\", described by Portnoy as \"a real heavy personal subject about my dad who passed away during the making of the album ... He was battling cancer throughout its making.\"  The band also embarked on a second Progressive Nation tour, including the tour's first performances in Europe. Opeth, Unexpect and Bigelf supported Dream Theater in Europe, while Zappa Plays Zappa, Pain Of Salvation, and Beardfish were slated to perform on the North American leg. However, Pain of Salvation and Beardfish were unable to tour with Dream Theater and Zappa Plays Zappa because of financial troubles within their respective record labels. The two new bands that filled the vacated slots for the Progressive Nation 2009 tour in North America were Bigelf and Scale the Summit with Bigelf performing on both European and North American legs.  After the Progressive Nation Tour, Dream Theater re-entered the studio to write and record a brand new instrumental track for inclusion on the God of War III soundtrack EP God of War: Blood & Metal. The track, entitled \"Raw Dog\" (God (of) War reversed), marked the first time that the band has written and recorded an exclusive track for an outside project. \"Raw Dog\" includes the first ever commercially recorded harpejji track, performed by Jordan Rudess, as well as Dream Theater's final recorded performance with Mike Portnoy on drums. In December 2009, during their Black Clouds & Silver Linings tour whilst visiting Australia, Dream Theater appeared with one support act, Pain of Salvation. In March 2010, they toured South America with Bigelf. Afterwards, during the summer of 2010, Dream Theater supported Iron Maiden on the US and Canadian legs of their summer tour which were the last shows DT played during 2010.

Follicular T helper (TFH) cells orchestrate the germinal center (GC) reaction locally. Local mechanisms regulating their dynamics and helper functions are not well defined. Here we found that GC-expressed ephrin B1 (EFNB1) repulsively inhibited T cell to B cell adhesion and GC TFH retention by signaling through TFH-expressed EPHB6 receptor. At the same time, EFNB1 promoted interleukin-21 production from GC TFH cells by signaling predominantly through EPHB4. Consequently, EFNB1-null GCs were associated with defective production of plasma cells despite harboring excessive TFH cells.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.   OBJECTIVE Folate and vitamin B12 are two vital regulators in the metabolic process of homocysteine, which is a risk factor of atherothrombotic events. Low folate intake or low plasma folate concentration is associated with increased stroke risk. Previous randomized controlled trials presented discordant findings in the effect of folic acid supplementation-based homocysteine lowering on stroke risk. The aim of the present review was to perform a meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials to check the how different folate fortification status might affect the effects of folic acid supplementation in lowering homocysteine and reducing stroke risk.     DESIGN Relevant randomized controlled trials were identified through formal literature search. Homocysteine reduction was compared in subgroups stratified by folate fortification status. Relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals were used as a measure to assess the association between folic acid supplementation and stroke risk.     SETTING The meta-analysis included fourteen randomized controlled trials,   SUBJECTS A total of 39 420 patients.     RESULTS Homocysteine reductions were 26·99 (sd 1·91) %, 18·38 (sd 3·82) % and 21·30 (sd 1·98) %, respectively, in the subgroups without folate fortification, with folate fortification and with partial folate fortification. Significant difference was observed between the subgroups with folate fortification and without folate fortification (P=0·05). The relative risk of stroke was 0·88 (95 % CI 0·77, 1·00, P=0·05) in the subgroup without folate fortification, 0·94 (95 % CI 0·58, 1·54, P=0·82) in the subgroup with folate fortification and 0·91 (95 % CI 0·82, 1·01, P=0·09) in the subgroup with partial folate fortification.     CONCLUSIONS Folic acid supplementation might have a modest benefit on stroke prevention in regions without folate fortification.", "answer": "The effect of folate fortification on folic acid-based homocysteine-lowering intervention and stroke risk: a meta-analysis."}

{"question": "Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.   My mother passed away at the end of March last year. My sister and I went to the cemetery where my father is buried to make arrangements to have her interred. It was a very sad, difficult week as she'd been on life support and we'd had to make the decision to remove her from the respirator. The doctors said she'd only live a few hours but she lived for several days and seemed really uncomfortable and in pain. It was a very difficult thing to watch and my sister and I were both kind of traumatized when we walked into our meeting with the funeral director. We knew that my mother had asked for a simple graveside service as most of her friends had passed away. We explained this to the funeral director and she really put pressure on us to upsell everything. We keep refusing, wanting to keep it simple, and this woman made us feel so uncomfortable - and cheap, which we aren't - that I was starting to get upset. After more than an hour of this woman pressuring us we finally made the arrangement we'd planned. We then went out to lunch just to recover from the verbal pummeling of this woman. The day finally arrived and after picking up flowers we got to the cemetery early. The service itself was nice. It was a pretty spring day and quite a few family members came. The funeral director was nice to us, which was a change from when we made the arrangements. Despite the awful experience of planning this it turned out well.", "answer": "retold"}

{"question": "Title: Merzbow Background: Masami Akita (Qiu Tian  Chang Mei , Akita Masami, born December 19, 1956), better known by his stage name Merzbow (merutsubau, Merutsubau), is a Japanese noise musician. He is best known for his style of harsh, confrontational noise exemplified on his 1996 release, Pulse Demon. Since 1980, he has released over 400 recordings, and has collaborated with various artists. Section: Laptop era (1999-2009) Passage: Since 1999, Akita has used computers in his recordings, having first acquired a Macintosh to work on art for the Merzbox. Also at this time he began referring to his home studio as \"Bedroom, Tokyo\". At live performances, Akita has produced noise music from either two laptop computers or combination of a laptop and analog synthesizers/guitar pedals. Reiko A. and Bara left Merzbow during this time, Reiko Azuma now has a solo career. Since 2001, Jenny Akita (nee Kawabata) started being credited for artwork on various releases.  Since 2001, Akita started utilising samples of animal sounds in various releases starting with Frog. Around 2002, Akita became a vegan, he stated how it began:  I started raising four bantams, the little ornamental chickens. With this experience as a start, I gradually started to be concerned and care about chickens and all the barn animals I used to eat without giving it a second thought before. So I started reading books and researching on the internet about Animal Rights and that triggered an awareness of \"evil\" that human society has done.  During this period, Akita also became a supporter of PETA which is reflected in his animal-themed releases. An example of this is Minazo Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, dedicated to an elephant seal he visited often at the zoo and Bloody Sea, a protest against Japanese whaling. He has also produced several works centered around recordings of his pet chickens (notably Animal Magnetism and Turmeric).  Also in 2002, Akita released Merzbeat, which was seen as a significant departure from his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that it sounded very similar to Aqua Necromancer (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. Merzbird (2004) and Merzbuddha (2005) followed in a similar vein with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What does laptop era refer to?

{"question": "Title: Pendulum (drum and bass band) Background: Pendulum is an Australian drum and bass and electronic rock band founded in 2002. Pendulum originally formed in the city of Perth, Western Australia by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen, and Paul \"El Hornet\" Harding. The band was later expanded to include members, Ben Mount, Peredur ap Gwynedd, and KJ Sawka. Members Swire and McGrillen also formed the electro house duo Knife Party. Section: Musical style Passage: When Pendulum was formed, their musical style was considerably more drum and bass sounding than the work they were known for later in their career. Signature tunes such as \"Masochist\", \"Vault\", \"Back 2 You\" and \"Voyager\", which were released on labels such as Uprising Records, 31 Records, Renegade Hardware and Low Profile Records, have a darker, more amelodic air to them which is substantially absent from their later productions. The band's newer work is regarded as generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Early work such as \"Another Planet\" seems to indicate an early affinity with a more global sound, similar to other Breakbeat Kaos artists such as DJ Fresh and Adam F.  The group has produced various remixes of other artists also; one of the best-known being the remix of \"Voodoo People\", originally by The Prodigy. In 2008-2010, they covered/remixed songs including Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\", Linkin Park's \"The Catalyst\", Calvin Harris's \"I'm Not Alone\", Coldplay's \"Violet Hill\", and Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\". Pendulum's versions of \"I'm Not Alone\" and \"Master Of Puppets\" both exist as studio recordings but have not been officially released, and are only previewed during DJ sets. The original live version of \"Master of Puppets\" was played as an instrumental introduction for \"Slam\", and was featured on their first live album/DVD. During their American tour as the supporting band for Linkin Park, the song was played in its entirety, with Rob doing vocals. Pendulum have also remixed their own music and, on occasion, television theme songs, such as Australian television's \"ABC News Theme\" in May 2010. The remix proved to be immensely popular with listeners of Australian youth radio station Triple J, polling at number 11 in the 2010 Triple J Hottest 100 countdown.  Pendulum's musical style consisted of a fusion of drum and bass (along with other electronic genres), alternative rock and heavy metal, with the inclusion of acoustic instruments. This creates a sound reminiscent of electronic rock, albeit with much more prominent drum and bass and, more recently, dubstep influences. Some songs, such as \"Slam\", \"Propane Nightmares\" and \"Witchcraft\" are synth-led, whilst others, such as \"Showdown\", \"The Tempest\" and \"Comprachicos\", are guitar-led. Bassist Gareth McGrillen stated in an interview on Channel 4 that they use 13 computers during the live performances, all of which are mixing the sounds produced by the instruments in real time. Rob Swire stated in issues of TJECK magazine and Rock Sound magazine that he would like to begin producing songs with a punk style to them, which Gareth clarified to mean \"A raw, aggressive, less polished method of producing\". Pendulum were known to be fans of progressive rock and progressive metal bands, which may have inspired them to fuse multiple genres of music together, which is standard practice in those genres. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what was the band's initial musical style? Answer: When Pendulum was formed, their musical style was considerably more drum and bass sounding Question: What type of style did they adopt after that? Answer: The band's newer work is regarded as generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Question: When did they change styles? Answer: In 2008-2010, they covered/remixed songs Question: what songs did they cover?

However, a dispute over the distribution of Disney's first full-length movie, The Living Desert, in the True-Life Adventures series of live-action documentary featurettes in 1953 led to Walt and his older brother Roy O. Disney to form its wholly owned subsidiary, the Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (BVDC), to handle North American distribution of their own products. RKO refused to distribute the film. The name \"Buena Vista\" came from the street in Burbank, California, where the Disney Studios was located (and remains to this day). Buena Vista's first release was the Academy Award–winning live-action feature The Living Desert on November 10, 1953, along with Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Buena Vista's first animated release.

Graphical Abstract Highlights d DENV NS4B induces mitochondria elongation during viral infection d Elongated mitochondria and virus-induced convoluted membranes are physically linked d NS4B inhibits activation of the mitochondrial fission factor DRP1 d Mitochondria elongation alleviates DENV-induced RIG-Idependent innate immunity SUMMARY With no antiviral drugs or widely available vaccines, Dengue virus (DENV) constitutes a public health concern. DENV replicates at ER-derived cytoplasmic structures that include substructures called convoluted membranes (CMs); however, the purpose of these membrane alterations remains unclear. We determine that DENV nonstructural protein (NS)4B, a promising drug target with unknown function, associates with mitochondrial proteins and alters mitochondria morphology to promote infection. During infection, NS4B induces elongation of mitochondria, which physically contact CMs. This restructuring compromises the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes, sites of ER-mitochondria interface critical for innate immune signaling. The spatio-temporal parameters of CM biogenesis and mitochondria elongation are linked to loss of activation of the fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein-1. Mitochondria elongation promotes DENV replication and alleviates RIG-I-dependent activation of interferon responses. As Zika virus infection induces similar mitochondria elongation, this perturbation may protect DENV and related viruses from innate immunity and create a favorable replicative environment.", "answer": "Dengue Virus Perturbs Mitochondrial Morphodynamics to Dampen Innate Immune Responses Article Dengue Virus Perturbs Mitochondrial Morphodynamics to Dampen Innate Immune Responses"}

{"question": "Title: Burt Bacharach Background: Burt Freeman Bacharach ( BAK-@-rak; born May 12, 1928) is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, pianist, and singer who has composed hundreds of popular hit songs from the late 1950s through the 1980s, many in collaboration with popular lyricist Hal David. A six-time Grammy Award winner and three-time Academy Award winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists. As of 2014, he had written 73 US and 52 UK Top 40 hits. He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century popular music. Section: Beginning work as musician Passage: Following his tour of duty in the United States Army, Bacharach spent the next three years as a pianist and conductor for popular singer Vic Damone. Damone recalls: \"Burt was clearly bound to go out on his own. He was an exceptionally talented, classically trained pianist, with very clear ideas on the musicality of songs, how they should be played, and what they should sound like. I appreciated his musical gifts.\" He later worked in similar capacity for various other singers, including Polly Bergen, Steve Lawrence, the Ames Brothers and Paula Stewart (who became his first wife). When he was unable to find better jobs, Bacharach worked at resorts in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where he accompanied singers such as Joel Grey.  In 1956, at age 28, Bacharach's productivity increased when composer Peter Matz recommended him to Marlene Dietrich, who needed an arranger and conductor for her nightclub shows. He then became part-time music director for Dietrich, the German actress and singer who had been an international screen star in the 1930s. They toured worldwide off and on until the early 1960s; when they weren't touring, he wrote songs. As a result of his collaboration with Dietrich, he gained his first major recognition as a conductor and arranger.  In her autobiography, she remembered that Bacharach loved touring in Russia and Poland because the violinists were \"extraordinary,\" and musicians were greatly appreciated by the public. He liked Edinburgh and Paris, along with the Scandinavian countries, and \"he also felt at home in Israel,\" she says, where music was similarly \"much revered.\" Their working relationship ceased by the early 1960s, after about five years with Dietrich, with Bacharach telling her that he wanted to devote his full-time to songwriting. She thought of her time with him as \"seventh heaven ... As a man, he embodied everything a woman could wish for. ... How many such men are there? For me he was the only one.\" CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did first become a musician Answer: Following his tour of duty in the United States Army, Bacharach spent the next three years as a pianist and conductor for popular singer Vic Damone.

{"question": "Title: Jumbo Background: Jumbo (about Christmas 1860 - September 15, 1885), also known as Jumbo the Elephant and Jumbo the Circus Elephant, was a 19th-century male African bush elephant born in Sudan. Jumbo was exported to Jardin des Plantes, a zoo in Paris and then transferred in 1865 to London Zoo in England. Despite public protest, Jumbo was sold to P. T. Barnum, who took him to the United States for exhibition in March 1882. The giant elephant's name has spawned the common word, \"jumbo\", meaning large in size. Section: Death Passage: Jumbo died at a railway classification yard in Canada at St. Thomas, Ontario on September 15, 1885. In those days the circus crisscrossed North America by train. St. Thomas was the perfect place for a circus because many rail lines converged in St. Thomas in that day. Jumbo and the other animals had finished their performances for the night and, as they were being led to their box car, a train came roaring down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes.  Barnum told the story that Tom Thumb, a young circus elephant was walking on the railroad tracks and Jumbo was attempting to lead him to safety. Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo. However, other witnesses did not support Barnum's account. According to newspapers, the freight train hit Jumbo directly, killing him, while Tom Thumb suffered a broken leg.  Many metallic objects were found in the elephant's stomach, including English pennies, keys, rivets, and a police whistle.  Ever the showman, Barnum had portions of his star attraction separated, in order to have multiple sites attracting curious spectators. After touring with Barnum's circus, the skeleton was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it remains. The elephant's heart was sold to Cornell University. Jumbo's hide was stuffed by William J. Critchley and Carl Akeley, both of Ward's Natural Science, who stretched it during the mounting process; the mounted specimen traveled with Barnum's circus for two years.  Barnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to Tufts University, where it was displayed at P.T. Barnum Hall there for many years. The hide was destroyed in a fire in April 1975. Ashes from that fire, which are believed to contain the elephant's remains, are kept in a 14-ounce Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter jar in the office of the Tufts athletic director, while his taxidermied tail, removed during earlier renovations, resides in the holdings of the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives. CANNOTANSWER  Question: How did Jumbo die? Answer: a train came roaring down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes. Question: When did this happen? Answer: Jumbo died at a railway classification yard in Canada at St. Thomas, Ontario on September 15, 1885. Question: What other details were there about Jumbo's death? Answer: Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo. However, other witnesses did not support Barnum's account. Question: Where was he buried?", "answer": "Barnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to Tufts University, where it was displayed at P.T. Barnum Hall there for many years."}
{"question": "Title: Bill Richardson Background: William Blaine Richardson III (born November 15, 1947) is an American politician, author, and diplomat who served as the 30th Governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011. He was U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Energy Secretary in the Clinton administration and has also served as a U.S. Congressman, chairman of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. In December 2008, he was nominated for the cabinet-level position of Secretary of Commerce in the first Obama administration, but withdrew a month later as he was investigated for possible improper business dealings in New Mexico. Although the investigation was later dropped, it was seen to have damaged Richardson's career, as his second and final term as New Mexico governor concluded. Section: U.S. Representative Passage: In 1978, Richardson moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and ran for the House of Representatives in 1980 as a Democrat, losing narrowly to longtime 1st District representative and future United States Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan (R). Two years later, Richardson was elected to New Mexico's newly created third district, taking in most of the northern part of the state. Richardson spent 14 years in Congress, representing the country's most diverse district and holding 2,000 town meetings.  Richardson served as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the 98th Congress (1983-1985) and as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Native American Affairs in the 103rd Congress (1993-1994). Richardson sponsored a number of bills, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments, the Indian Dams Safety Act, the Tribal Self-Governance Act, and the Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act.  He became a member of the Democratic leadership as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milosevic. In 1996, he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Did he run for the house of representative? Answer: Richardson moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and ran for the House of Representatives in 1980 as a Democrat, Question: Did he win or lose? Answer: losing narrowly Question: Who was his opponent?

To investigate the current status of health care waste management at different levels of health care facilities (HCF) after the implementation of these regulations, one tertiary hospital, one secondary hospital, and four primary health care centers from Binzhou District were visited and 145 medical staff members and 24 cleaning personnel were interviewed. Generated medical waste totaled 1.22, 0.77, and 1.17 kg/bed/day in tertiary, secondary, and primary HCF, respectively. The amount of medical waste generated in primary health care centers was much higher than that in secondary hospitals, which may be attributed to general waste being mixed with medical waste. This study found that the level of the HCF, responsibility for medical waste management in departments and wards, educational background and training experience can be factors that determine medical staff members' knowledge of health care waste management policy. Regular training programs and sufficient provision of protective measures are urgently needed to improve occupational safety for cleaning personnel. Financing and administrative monitoring by local authorities is needed to improve handling practices and the implementation of off-site centralized disposal in primary health care centers.", "answer": "Investigation of health care waste management in Binzhou District, China"}

{"question": "Gas station owner: Increased fuel efficiency reduces air pollution and dependence on imported oil, which has led some people to suggest that automobile manufacturers should make cars smaller to increase their fuel efficiency. But smaller cars are more likely to be seriously damaged in collisions and provide less protection for their occupants. Greater fuel efficiency is not worth the added risk to human lives; ttherefore, manufacturers should not seek to increase fuel efficiency. The reasoning in the gas station owner's argument is flawed because the argument A: presumes, without providing justification, that it would be impossible to reduce the likelihood of dangerous accidents for small cars B: concludes, on the basis of the claim that one means to an end is unacceptable, that the end should not be pursued C: presumes, without providing justification, that increasing fuel efficiency is the only way to reduce air pollution D: presupposes the truth of what it sets out to proveChoose A, B, C or D as your solution.", "answer": "B"}

{"question": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.   Since 1999 we have developed two computational mutation approaches to analyze the protein primary structure whose methodology and implications were reviewed in 2002. Our first approach is the calculation of predictable and unpredictable portions of amino-acid pairs in a protein, and the second is the calculation of amino-acid distribution rank in a protein. Both approaches provide quantitative measures to present a protein, which we have used to study a number of proteins with numerous mutations such as p53 proteins. More recently, we focussed our efforts on analyzing the proteins mutating frequently over time such as hemagglutinins of influenza A viruses. In this review we summarise our findings and their implications for hemagglutinin mutations in combination with some newly available data. Our approaches throw light on the true nature of genetic heterogeneity of influenza virus hemagglutinins; that is, the protein variability is highly relevant to its amino-acid construction. Using these approaches, we can monitor new mutations from influenza virus hemagglutinins and may predict their mutations in the future.", "answer": "Mutation trend of hemagglutinin of influenza A virus: a review from a computational mutation viewpoint"}
{"question": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not.   My roommate and I have lived together for almost 2 years now. When we first moved in, there was a bit of a controversy over who got the bigger room. I obviously wanted the bigger room so I told her I would cover the electric bill for the extra 5 square feet of space (stupid, I know). This year, I am in the apartment a lot less because I go home to visit my family more often. Our electric bill has been obnoxiously high lately for only two people living here, especially since I’m only here a few days out of the week.  She is here every day of the week and is terrible at turning off the lights or the television. I usually fall asleep before her, but when I wake up in the morning I notice that she turned on every light in the kitchen and living area including the lights being on in her bedroom. Not only is keeping the lights on all day every day a waste of money, it’s not good for the environment. I tried to be nice about it by telling her to try to be better at turning off the lights if she isn’t using them.   Last year, I went grocery shopping for the apartment often, and she just constantly ate the food I would buy. I don’t have a problem sharing bread, butter, or any of the basics, but she thinks that everything is free range for her. This year I started buying less groceries because I am here less, but she still finds a way to eat all of my groceries. She makes all of my coffee k-cups and she doesn’t even finish the coffee. I don’t use anything of hers or eat any of her food (because she doesn’t buy any). On top of everything, she is the most entitled person I’ve ever met. She doesn’t have a job and treats her parents (who give her all of her money) like they’re an inconvenience to her.   She is also very messy, she will leave her stuff in the living area for days on end... from laundry and textbooks to her cats litter box (which we agreed would stay in her room). I also didn’t agree to a cat in the first place, considering I’m allergic.   She comes into my bedroom whenever she wants and who knows what she does when I’m not here. We’ve been friends for years but it’s ridiculous how little boundaries she has and how little she chips in for ANYTHING. I know I’m a pushover and should have addressed this earlier, but I just don’t want to feel like I’ll be the one in the wrong if I do.

The official campaign against EU membership - Vote Leave - launched its Welsh campaign for the 23 June referendum in Cardiff on Saturday. Ex-defence secretary Dr Liam Fox said leaving could save the UK £350m a week. Wales Stronger In Europe, the official pro-EU Remain campaign, said Dr Fox's claims were \"a flight from reality\". \"Leaving the EU and taking back control of our own affairs would be a huge boost to public services in Wales, with more money available for hospitals, schools, and local services,\" said the former Conservative UK cabinet minister. \"Proponents of 'Project Fear' claim that Wales will be worse off financially if we leave the EU, but there is no such thing as EU money - it's already yours. \"Instead of handing over £350m a week to Brussels we should be spending that money on local priorities like the Welsh NHS, which has faced a billion pounds of cuts by the Welsh Labour Government since 2011. \"That's why we must seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take back control of our own destiny, and put decision-making back in to local hands.\" Reality Check: Would Brexit mean extra £350m a week saved? We've said it before and we'll say it again - the UK does not send £350m a week to Brussels - the rebate is deducted before the money is sent, which takes the contribution down to £276m a week. That figure includes £88m a week spent in the UK on things like regional aid and support for farmers. The UK government could decide after a Brexit that it should take that money away from farmers and give it instead to the NHS, but it might be an unpopular decision in rural areas.

{"question": "Early in the development of a new product line, the critical resource is talent. New marketing ventures require a degree of managerial skill disproportionate to their short-term revenue prospects. Usually, however, talented managers are assigned only to established high-revenue product lines and, as a result, most new marketing ventures fail. Contrary to current practice, the best managers in a company should be assigned to development projects. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the author's argument? A: For most established companies, the development of new product lines is a relatively small part of the company's total expenditure. B: Early short-term revenue prospects of a new product line are usually a good predictor of how successful a product line will ultimately be. C: The current revenue and profitability of an established product line can be maintained even if the company's best managers are assigned elsewhere. D: The more talented a manager is, the less likely he or she is to be interested in undertaking the development of a new product line.Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.", "answer": "C"}

{"question": "In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.   Writing in the 152nd edition of the yearly almanac, Booth criticises the England and Wales Cricket Board's handling of the Kevin Pietersen affair. He also raises concerns with the decline of the Test and one-day sides and a fall in grassroots participation. England internationals Moeen Ali and Gary Ballance are among Wisden's five cricketers of the year. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews and New Zealand's Jeetan Patel make up the list. England's 2014 started with an Ashes whitewash at the hands of Australia, took in losses in 28 matches across all formats, and included a humbling by international minnows the Netherlands in the World T20. \"In 2014 English cricket repeatedly lost touch - not just with things it wished had never happened, but with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all,\" said Booth, who went on to link a lack of conviction among ECB decision makers with the team's poor form. \"The power brokers indulged in mutual backslapping... It was a nexus of self-preservation - yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to come off.\" The ECB declined to comment on Booth's criticism when contacted by BBC Sport. However, incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who is set to take over in May, has already suggested he expects to make sweeping changes to improve the game. Pietersen, 34, was sacked by England after the 5-0 Ashes defeat by Australia and, while the South African-born batsman has said he would like to return to the international fold, his future remains uncertain. \"It was typical of a story beyond the ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making,\" said Booth. \"Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution: an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen, 'Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for you…'. \"All the while, he kept insisting how happy he was in the land of Twenty20 franchises - and agitating for an international recall. The whole thing would have been sad, if it hadn't been so absurd.\" Alastair Cook had looked set to lead England into the World Cup - despite a 3-1 one-day series defeat by India in the autumn - after ECB managing director Paul Downton said he would be \"surprised\" if the batsman was removed as captain. But he was sacked in December, just two months before what would turn out to be a disastrous World Cup. \"To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,\" said Booth. \"Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith. \"England overplayed their hand: the Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone - except to the men who run the game.\" The ECB found that the number of people playing cricket in teams fell 7% between 2013 and 2014, from from 908,000 in 2013 to 844,000 in 2014. And Booth has called on the ECB to do more to advance the game in Asian communities: \"The English game needs an Asian player to prosper beyond a few Tests here and there. \"If the England team really want to unlock their full potential, it is perverse to be so reliant on (white) southern Africans and smash-and-grab raids across the Irish Sea, and so ignore the more natural solution on our doorstep. \"There remains a damaging perception among Britain's South Asian communities that its best young cricketers are not wanted.\" All-rounder Ali, 27, was named as one of Wisden's five players of 2014 in a year in which he took 19 wickets in the Test series victory over India, while 25-year-old Ballance registered three Test centuries and averaged 60.75. Lyth, 27, helped Yorkshire to the County Championship title by leading the scoring charts with 1,489 runs, while spinner Patel, 34, was commended for his 107 wickets for Warwickshire across all formats. And Mathews was included for his influence in Sri Lanka's first ever Test series victory in England. Sri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara was named leading cricketer in the world, while Australia batsman Meg Lanning is Wisden's first leading woman cricketer in the world.", "answer": "England's cricket leaders \"repeatedly lost touch\" in 2014, says Wisden editor Lawrence Booth."}

{"question": "Title: Al Sharpton Background: Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, to Ada (nee Richards) and Alfred Charles Sharpton Sr. The family has some Cherokee roots. He preached his first sermon at the age of four and toured with gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. In 1963, Sharpton's father left his wife to have a relationship with Sharpton's half-sister. Section: Work as FBI informant Passage: Sharpton said in 1988 that he informed for the government in order to stem the flow of crack cocaine into black neighborhoods. He denied informing on civil rights leaders.  In 2002, HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel aired a 19-year-old FBI videotape of an undercover sting operation showing Sharpton with an undercover FBI agent posing as a Latin American businessman and a reputed Colombo crime family captain. During the discussion, the undercover agent offered Sharpton a 10% commission for arranging drug sales. On the videotape, Sharpton mostly nods and allows the FBI agent to do most of the talking. No drug deal was ever consummated, and no charges were brought against Sharpton as a result of the tape.  In April 2014, The Smoking Gun obtained documents indicating that Sharpton became an FBI informant in 1983 following Sharpton's role in a drug sting involving Colombo crime family captain Michael Franzese. Sharpton allegedly recorded incriminating conversations with Genovese and Gambino family mobsters, contributing to the indictments of several underworld figures. Sharpton is referred to in FBI documents as \"CI-7.\"  Summarizing the evidence supporting that Sharpton was an active FBI informant in the 1980s, William Bastone, the Smoking Gun's founder, stated: \"If he (Sharpton) didn't think he was an informant, the 'Genovese squad' of the FBI and NYPD officials sure knew him to be an informant. He was paid to be an informant, he carried a briefcase with a recording device in it, and he made surreptitious tape recordings of a Gambino crime family member 10 separate times as an informant. He did it at the direction of the FBI, he was prepped by the FBI, was handed the briefcase by the FBI and was debriefed after the meetings. That's an informant.\" Sharpton disputes portions of the allegations.  Sharpton is alleged to have secretly recorded conversations with black activists in the 1980s regarding Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) and other underground black militants. Veteran activist Ahmed Obafemi told the New York Daily News that he had long suspected Sharpton of taping him with the bugged briefcase.

{"question": "Article: By . Jonathan Petre . PUBLISHED: . 19:18 EST, 6 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:18 EST, 6 October 2012 . Lord Carey, pictured, is certain any moves to change the law on gay marriage will put society 'on a slippery slope where the unintended consequences could be shocking' David Cameron's plans to allow gay marriage could have ‘drastic’ consequences, even allowing men to marry more than one woman, the former Archbishop of Canterbury will warn Conservatives tomorrow. In a speech at this week’s party conference, Lord Carey will say same-sex marriages ‘strike at the very fabric of society’. He will say it is difficult to know at this stage what the consequences would be if gay marriage were introduced, according to a draft seen by The Mail on Sunday. But he will cite developments in other countries where the law is being liberalised, including France, where the government intends to ban the words ‘mother and father’ from official documents, replacing them with ‘parents’. Lord Carey, who also writes in The Mail on Sunday today that the Government needs to confront the ‘divisive’ issue of immigration, will add: ‘We can be sure any move away from our traditional understanding of marriage is to put our society on a slippery slope where the unintended consequences could be shocking.

{"question": "Title: Jack White Background: John Anthony Gillis was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of ten children--and the seventh son--of Teresa (nee Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was Scottish-Canadian. He was raised a Catholic, and his father and mother both worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. Gillis became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. Section: 'Eccentricity' Passage: White has been called \"eccentric.\" He is known for creating mythology around his endeavors; examples include his claim that the Stripes began on Bastille Day, that he and Meg are the two youngest of ten siblings, and that Third Man Records used to be a candy factory. These assertions came into question or were disproven, such as when, in 2002, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate for him and Meg, confirming their history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially, and Jack continues to refer to Meg as his sister in interviews, including in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights, filmed in 2007. In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Jack alluded to this open secret, implying that it was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couple's relationship:  \"When you see a band that is two pieces, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, you think, 'Oh, I see...' When they're brother and sister, you go, 'Oh, that's interesting.' You care more about the music, not the relationship--whether they're trying to save their relationship by being in a band.\"  He has an attachment to the number three, stemming from seeing three staples in the back of a Vladimir Kagan couch he helped to upholster as an apprentice. His business ventures frequently feature \"three\" in the title and he typically appends \"III\" to the end of his name. During the White Stripes 2005 tour in the UK, White began referring to himself as \"Three Quid\"--\"quid\" being British slang for pound sterling.  He maintains an aesthetic that he says challenges whether people will believe he is \"real.\" He frequently color-codes his endeavors, such as the aforementioned Third Man Upholstery and The White Stripes, as well as Third Man Records, which is completely outfitted in yellow, black, red, and blue (including staff uniforms). As a taxidermy enthusiast--that correlates to his work as an upholsterer--he decorates his studio in preserved animals, including a peacock, giraffe, and Himalayan goat.

{"question": "Title: Lyndon B. Johnson Background: Lyndon Baines Johnson (; August 27, 1908 - January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th President of the United States from 1963 to 1969, assuming the office after having served as the 37th Vice President of the United States from 1961 to 1963. A Democrat from Texas, he also served as a United States Representative and as the Majority Leader in the United States Senate. Johnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions. Section: \"War on Poverty\" and healthcare reform Passage: In 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act, as part of the war on poverty. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start, food stamps and Work Study. During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent.  Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the \"Demonstration Cities Program\". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to \"arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city.\" Johnson requested an investment of $400 million per year totaling $2.4 billion. In the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900 million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill; the New York Times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure.  Johnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Strokes (HDCS). Combined, these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation's deaths in 1962. To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered down version.  As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake--hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans. Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What was Johnson's War on Poverty? Answer: Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act, as part of the war on poverty. Question: Why did he feel he needed to act? Answer: During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent.

That distance is now rarely run as the NFHS converted to metric distances, so the record still stands today.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a frequently fatal clinicopathologic syndrome in which an uncontrolled and ineffective immune response leads to severe hyperinflammation. It may occur as either a familial disorder or a sporadic condition in association with a variety of triggers: infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and acquired immune deficiencies. However, the most consistent association is with viral infections, especially Epstein---Barr virus. The main clinical features are fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities and pancytopenia. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reducing mortality, but the diagnosis is difficult because of the rarity of the syndrome and the lack of specificity of the clinical findings. Treatment should be directed toward treating the underlying disease and to suppressing the exaggerated inflammatory response through the use of immunosuppressive agents.

Farmers from southern Italy presenting their wares at a London food festival this week say their hemp pasta, oil and bread won’t get you high, but do provide a healthy, tasty alternative to the traditional, wheat variety. “Hemp food is truly organic,” said Marzio Ilario Fiore, 30, whose farm in the Molise region produces hemp oil and flour. “Hemp requires no pesticides, no fertilizers, and only moderate amounts of water.”    Cannabis is most often associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana, but some strains of the plant can also be cultivated for food. High-growing varieties called hemp, which contain negligible levels of the drug THC, have long been grown to produce food and other products. Italy lifted a ban on hemp cultivation in 1998. “My crop gets regularly checked by Italian police inspectors to ensure that THC is within the legal limit,” said Fiore, one of some 200 Italian food artisans in London for the three-day Bellavita (“Beautiful Life”) Expo. As well as spaghetti made from hemp flour, he provided tastings of hemp taralli - hard savory biscuits from southern Italy - and hemp oil, which has a distinctive, nutty flavor. Hemp seeds are one of the richest sources of vegetarian protein, with high concentrations of omega fatty acids, growers say. While most pasta makers have yet to venture into the hemp market, they are finding new ways to present the staple, patenting new pasta shapes and sizes. La Molisana, for example, showed off its square-shaped variety of spaghetti, the so-called ‘spaghetto quadrato’. Wine makers, too, are looking for ways to differentiate their products, with one producer aging its bottles on the sea bed for up to a year before selling them, encrusted with algae. “The lack of light and constant temperature combined with the ‘massage’ effect of the tides produces great results,” said Gianluca Grilli, co-founder of the Tenuta del Paguro which won Bellavita’s best beverage business award, worth 10,000 euros. Tenuta del Paguro uses the wreck of the Paguro oil drilling platform, which sank in the Adriatic Sea in 1965, to store its wine underwater. The three reds and one white are produced in Riolo Terme, near Ravenna, in central Italy, before being sent to mature under the waves. The bottles sell in Italy for 100-150 euros  ($110-160) each, Grilli said. Bellavita offered a maze of hanging salami and cheese from across Italy, including provolone from the milk of the Agerolese cow, a protected crossbreed from the south, as well as cookies flavored with lavender and rosewood extract called ‘Furezze’, from the Venetian dialect word ‘sfureso’, meaning delicacy.", "answer": "High on the menu: cannabis spaghetti features at Italian foodfest."}

The story comes a whisker away from earning a satisfactory on this one. It leads by noting that participants with the highest vitamin E intakes had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared with those who had the lowest intakes, It more precisely quantifies this benefit later in the story, where it explains that 120 people developed dementia in the group with the highest vitamin E intake compared with 164 people in the low- intake group. What would have been most informative, however, is if the story had provided some denominators for this comparison — that is, 120 out of how many people developed dementia in the first group compared with 164 out of how many people in the second? This would given readers a better sense of the absolute risk reduction associated with higher vitamin E intake. We know this sets the bar high, but for good reason, we think. There are no known harms to eating a diet rich in foods containing vitamin E, but this story goes the extra mile and notes that high vitamin E intake from supplements can cause excessive bleeding. The story uses appropriate language and caveats when reporting on the results of this observational study. It notes that the findings \"\"do not prove that vitamin E itself protects the aging brain,\"\" and there is no talk about vitamin E \"\"lowering the risk\"\" of dementia. The story also provides the key details regarding how the researchers conducted the study, including the number of participants; how vitamin E intake was assessed; how long the participants were followed; what confounding factors were included in the analysis; and how much vitamin E participants were getting in the group that had the lowest risk. Had the story sought out a comment from an expert in nutritional epidemiology, they likely would have pointed out some problems with trying to assess dietary intake from a single baseline questionnaire as was used in this study. They also would have provided additional context about the MANY other studies (including other large cohorts) that have looked at associations between antioxidants and dementia/ cognitive decline. Nevertheless, readers can’t miss the take-home message, which is that these findings are not conclusive. There was no disease-mongering of dementia in this story. Although the story is generally well balanced, it could have benefited from the inclusion of an independent comment on the findings. Valuable context about prior studies and the serious limitations of the current study would have been helpful. There is currently no proven method for preventing age-related dementia. We might have wished that this story had mentioned some other diet and lifestyle choices that are associated with reduced risk in observational studies. These include staying physically active, not smoking, eating a Mediterranean-style diet (rich in fruits and vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids), and keeping your mind engaged in intellectually challenging pursuits. But since the evidence is kind of squishy for all of this, we rule this satisfactory. The story provides a list of foods that are rich in this micronutrient. The idea that vitamin E and other antioxidants might protect against dementia is not new, and the story doesn’t suggest that it is. While the story doesn’t appear to have lifted anything directly from the press release issued for this study, it also doesn’t seem to have interviewed anyone about the research. Since we can’t be sure to what extent the story relied on a release, we’ll call it not applicable.\"", "answer": "Higher vitamin E intake tied to lower dementia risk"}

{"question": "Title: Van Halen Background: Van Halen is an American hard rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. Section: Gary Cherone era (1996-99) Passage: Van Halen's next lead singer was Gary Cherone, frontman of the then-defunct Boston-based band Extreme, a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s. The result was the album Van Halen III. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs (\"How Many Say I,\" with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, Van Halen III did produce the hit \"Without You,\" and another album track, \"Fire in the Hole,\" appeared on the Lethal Weapon 4 soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The III Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and New Zealand.  Shortly afterwards, Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999, they started work on a new album. Working titles of songs included \"Left for Dead,\" \"River Wide,\" \"Say Uncle,\" \"You Wear it Well,\" \"More Than Yesterday,\" \"I Don't Miss You ... Much,\" \"Love Divine,\" and \"From Here, Where Do We Go?\". The project was left unfinished when Cherone left the band amicably in November 1999. Citing musical differences, it is likely III's poor sales and critical reception had a big impact. None of the material from these sessions has ever been released, and in fact the band released no new material at all until three new songs were included on the 2004 Best of Both Worlds compilation. Lyrics that Cherone had written for the Van Halen III follow up would be used in his next project with Tribe of Judah.  Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie would later admit that \"the powers that be\" (Warner Bros.) had forced his hand in parting with Cherone. Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen. As when Hagar left, speculation resumed on a Roth reunion. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What can you tell me about Gary Cherone?

{"question": "Title: Frenzal Rhomb Background: Frenzal Rhomb is an Australian punk rock band that formed in 1992, with Jason Whalley on lead vocals and rhythm guitar during this entire period. In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), Section: 2005-2009: Jay and the Doctor and Forever Malcolm Young Passage: Frenzal Rhomb's Whalley and McDougall worked as Jay and the Doctor on Triple J's breakfast show from January 2005 through to November 2007. Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group's music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the \"same 40 songs\". In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide \"quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, Australian Idol and St Ives. It's verbal ping pong but more discursive.\"  The band released Forever Malcolm Young in October 2006 - the title is a conflated reference to the 2005 song \"Forever Young\" by Youth Group and the name of AC/DC's guitarist, Malcolm Young - which peaked in the top 40. It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of \"Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt\" (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones). Whalley's attitude to profanity and obscenity is \"I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn't hear in your local office or schoolyard. But we do make a point of shaking things up\". Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them \"[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic.\"  National touring followed the album's release, along with the announcement that from November 2007 Whalley would be leaving both Frenzal Rhomb and his job at Triple J to go on a world trip with his girlfriend. Some later copies of Forever Malcolm Young contained a bonus DVD covering the band's tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled Sucking All Over the World. Gordy Forman plays in the Melbourne hardcore band Mindsnare. McDougall continued as The Doctor at Triple J, initially with Robbie Buck and Marieke Hardy; and, from January 2010, he has hosted the afternoon show Drive with The Doctor. By April 2009, Frenzal Rhomb were performing The Boys Are Back in Town tour with 1990s punk group Nancy Vandal as their support act.

He preached his first sermon at the age of four and toured with gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. In 1963, Sharpton's father left his wife to have a relationship with Sharpton's half-sister. Section: Tawana Brawley rape case Passage: On November 28, 1987, Tawana Brawley, a 15-year-old black girl, was found smeared with feces, lying in a garbage bag, her clothing torn and burned and with various slurs and epithets written on her body in charcoal. Brawley claimed she had been assaulted and raped by six white men, some of them police officers, in the town of Wappinger, New York.  Attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason joined Sharpton in support of Brawley. A grand jury was convened; after seven months of examining police and medical records, the jury found \"overwhelming evidence\" that Brawley had fabricated her story. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason had accused the Dutchess County prosecutor, Steven Pagones, of racism and of being one of the perpetrators of the alleged abduction and rape. The three were successfully sued for defamation, and were ordered to pay $345,000 in damages, with the jury finding Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two, and Mason for one. Sharpton refused to pay his share of the damages; it was later paid by a number of black business leaders including Johnnie Cochran.  In 2007, Sharpton said he would handle the case the same today, with the only difference being that he would not have made it so personal against Pagones. He said that he still felt Brawley had a good case to go to trial, saying in an interview: \"I disagreed with the grand jury on Brawley. I believed there was enough evidence to go to trial. Grand jury said there wasn't. Okay, fine. Do I have a right to disagree with the grand jury? Many Americans believe O.J. Simpson was guilty. A jury said he wasn't.

Saudi Arabian women will be forced to hide behind a screen when they take their place in the country's main advisory body. A Saudi official says a screen will separate men and women on the Shura Council, which advises King Abdullah, when women join it for the first time. King Abdullah made the decision to allow women to join the Shura Council, which is expected to reconvene early next year, but appears to be making a compromise with the nation's hardline Islamists, who oppose growing women's rights in the highly-segregated country. Segregated: Women who are now able to join the Shura Council, a council which advises Saudi King Abdullah, will be forced to do so from behind a screen . Abdullah has pledged to allow women to vote and run in the next municipal elections in 2015. But Saudi women still face many restrictions, including a ban on driving. The official, quoted in Al-Watan newspaper on Wednesday, says an internal communications network will allow men and women to communicate despite the barrier. King Abdullah has insituted a number of reforms to the strict rules governing women in the oil-rich kingdom. This summer Saudi women were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games for the first time. Olympic bosses said the country could be disqualified for gender discrimination after it appeared to block female athletes from taking part, but the country relented. Athlete: A number of reforms surrounding women have been made in the kingdom. Women athletes like Sarah Attar competed in the Olympics this summer . Saudi Arabia is also planning to build a new city exclusively for women as it bids to combine strict Sharia law and career minded females, pursuing work. It is thought the Saudi Industrial Property Authority has been asked to bring the country up to date with the rest of the modern world with the controversial city, which is now being designed with construction to begin next year. It is hoped it will allow women’s desire to work without defying the country’s Islamic laws.

(this is where 1st fuck up begins) so i rolled it up and set it on fire and my friend got a little anxious becouse there was some guy coming towards the car, but i was like \"meh don't sweat it dude nothing is gonna happen\". so this guy stops at the window and suddenly flashes the goddamn badge at my friend who was driving. fuck. shit, fuck, bad. i opened my doors and threw a joint under the car. bad idea since mister undercover police man saw the whole thing. he asked us to get out of the car and to empty our pockets and hand over ids etc. etc. he didn't find anything on me thank to god but he asked the driver to back up his car a bit and picked up my tiny joint. i conffesed and so he collected my information and drove off.

{"question": "Title: Elbridge Gerry Background: Elbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in Marblehead, Massachusetts. His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth (Greenleaf) Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant. Gerry's first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mother's ancestors. Gerry's parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood. Section: United States House of Representatives Passage: Anti-Federalist forces nominated Gerry for governor in 1788, but he was predictably defeated by the popular incumbent John Hancock. Following ratification, Gerry recanted his opposition to the Constitution, noting that a number of state ratifying conventions had called for amendments that he supported. He was nominated by friends (over his own opposition to the idea) for a seat in the inaugural House of Representatives, where he then served two terms.  In June 1789 Gerry proposed that Congress consider all of the proposed constitutional amendments that various state ratifying conventions had called for (notably those of Rhode Island and North Carolina, which had at the time still not ratified the constitution). In the debate that followed, he led opposition to some of the proposals, arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties. He successfully lobbied for inclusion of freedom of assembly in the First Amendment, and was a leading architect of the Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure. He sought unsuccessfully to insert the word \"expressly\" into the Tenth Amendment, which might have more significantly limited the federal government's power. He was successful in efforts to severely limit the federal government's ability to control state militias. In tandem, with this protection, he had once argued against the idea of the federal government controlling a large standing army, comparing it - most memorably and mischievously - to a standing penis: \"An excellent assurance of domestic tranquility, but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure.\"  Gerry vigorously supported Alexander Hamilton's reports on public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamilton's new Bank of the United States, positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization. Although he speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit (the IOUs at issue), there is no evidence he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank. He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to republican ideals, and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties. He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the Treasury Department because its head might gain more power than the President. He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency (such as the ability to fire cabinet officers), seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments.  Gerry did not stand for re-election in 1792, returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife. He agreed to serve as a presidential elector for John Adams in the 1796 election. During Adams' term in office, Gerry maintained good relations with both Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, hoping that the divided executive might lead to less friction. His hopes were not realized: the split between Federalists (Adams) and Democratic-Republicans (Jefferson) widened.

{"question": "In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.   John Cornwell was posthumously awarded the medal for his actions during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, 1916. The letter from the Admiralty tells his mother, Lily Cornwell, of the honour and asks whether she would like to receive it on his behalf from the King. It fetched Â£2,500 in an auction run by Kent-based C&T Auctions. Matthew Tredwen, of C&T Auctions, originally expected the letter to fetch between Â£800 and Â£1,000. Cornwell, who was born in Leyton, then part of Essex, tried to enlist in Royal Navy at the outbreak of WWI in 1914, but was rejected because of his age. He joined up in 1915 without his father's permission and following basic training at Plymouth was assigned to the light cruiser, HMS Chester. The vessel came under intense fire during the Battle of Jutland, which saw the British and German fleets of dreadnought class battleships come to blows for the only time during the conflict. After the action, Cornwell who was the sole survivor at his gun, was found with shards of steel penetrating his chest, still looking at the weapon's sights and awaiting orders. He was transferred to Grimsby General Hospital but died two days later. Mrs Cornwell received her son's Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace in November 1916. The medal is the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The letter is accompanied by an official document sent to Admiral Beresford about a fund to be established in his memory. A painting depicting Cornwell at his gun post on HMS Chester hangs in St Paul's Church at HMS Raleigh, the Royal Navy's training base in Cornwall.

{"question": "Title: Joe Walsh Background: Joseph Fidler Walsh (born November 20, 1947) is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. In a career spanning more than forty years, he has been a member of five successful rock bands: James Gang, Barnstorm, Eagles, the Party Boys, and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In the 1990s, he was also a member of the short-lived supergroup the Best. Walsh has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician, being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings. Section: Early life and education Passage: Joseph Fidler Walsh was born on November 20, 1947 in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Robert Newton Fidler and grandson of Alden Anderson Fidler and Dora Jay Newton. Walsh's mother was a classically trained pianist of Scottish and German ancestry, and Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five after his biological father was killed in a plane crash. In the 1950s, it was common practice for Social Security, school registration, and health records for children to take the name of their stepfather, but Walsh's birth father's last name was Fidler, so he took that as his middle name.  Walsh and his family lived in Columbus, Ohio, for a number of years during his youth. When Walsh was twelve years old, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to Montclair, New Jersey, and he attended Montclair High School, where he played oboe in the school band.  Inspired by the success of the Beatles, he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group the Nomads in Montclair, beginning his career as a rock musician. After high school, Walsh attended Kent State University, where he spent time in various bands playing around the Cleveland area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for Super K Productions' Ohio Express the songs \"I Find I Think of You\", \"And It's True\", and \"Maybe\" (an instrumental version of \"And It's True\"). Walsh majored in English and minored in music; he was present during the Kent State massacre in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: \"Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don't need a degree that bad.\" After one term, he dropped out of university to pursue his musical career. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When was Joe Walsh born?

{"question": "Title: Agatha Christie Background: Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan,  (nee Miller; 15 September 1890 - 12 January 1976) was an English writer. She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature. Section: Character stereotypes Passage: Christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans, the last usually as impossibly naive or uninformed. For example, she described \"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the first editions of the collection The Mysterious Mr Quin (1930), in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \"sallow men\" wearing same.  In The Hollow, published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (Hallowe'en Party) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in Three Act Tragedy), but they are rarely the culprits.  Often, she is affectionate or teasing with her prejudices. After four years of war-torn London, Christie hoped to return some day to Syria, which she described as \"gentle fertile country and its simple people, who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life; who are idle and gay, and who have dignity, good manners, and a great sense of humour, and to whom death is not terrible.\"  She had trouble with an incompetent Swiss French nursery helper (Marcelle) for toddler Rosalind, and as a result she decided, \"Scottish preferred ... good with the young. The French were hopeless disciplinarians ... Germans good and methodical, but it was not German that I really wanted Rosalind to learn. The Irish were gay but made trouble in the house; the English were of all kinds\". CANNOTANSWER  Question: What are the stereotypes involved in this article?

I feel like I'm writing on paper, but paper that can magically re-write my handwriting as typed text (note: you will need a paid version of OneNote for that feature).<br /><br />I haven't had any battery life issues or sleeps of death that I've seen other people talk about.  I guess I'm lucky.  When I play my games, it does need to be plugged in, but otherwise I can get upwards of 8 hours of use out of it.<br /><br />Overall, I would heartily recommend this device for anyone looking to get rid of a laptop and maybe downsize. It's just amazing.", "answer": "I love everything about it and will not go back"}

{"question": "In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context.   Context: Identification of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease in the intestinal tract by PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging can be hampered by physiological uptake of F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) in the normal colon. Previous work has localized this F-FDG uptake to the intestinal lumen, predominantly occupied by bacteria. We sought to determine whether pretreatment with an antibiotic could reduce F-FDG uptake in the healthy colon.', 'Thirty patients undergoing restaging PET/CT for nongastrointestinal lymphoma were randomly selected to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice daily for 2 days before their scan (post-rifaximin). Their PET/CT images were compared with those from their prior study (pre-rifaximin). Cecal maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) and overall colonic F-FDG uptake were compared between scans. All PET/CT images were blindly scored by a radiologist. The same comparison of sequential scans was also undertaken in 30 patients who did not receive antibiotics.', \"Thirty post-rifaximin scans were compared with 30 pre-rifaximin scans in the same patients. SUVmax in the cecum was significantly lower in the patient's post-rifaximin scans than in their pre-rifaximin scans (P=0.002). The percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in the post-rifaximin scans than in the pre-rifaximin scans (P<0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the paired sequential scans from control patients, nor a reduction in the percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake.\\Question: Does rifaximin suppress background intestinal 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT scans?", "answer": "This pilot study shows that treatment with rifaximin for 2 days before PET/CT scanning can significantly reduce physiological F-FDG uptake in the normal colonic lumen."}

{"question": "Title: Bobby Timmons Background: Timmons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Section: 1954 to spring 1961 Passage: Timmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956-57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957-58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957.  Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that \"He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky - he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.\" By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.  Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: The Encyclopedia of Jazz states that his compositions \"Moanin'\" (from the 1958 album of the same title), \"This Here\", and \"Dat Dere\" \"helped generate the gospel-tinged 'soul jazz' style of [the] late '50s and early '60s.\" The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. \"This Here\" (sometimes \"Dis Here\") was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play.  Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from \"This Here\", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The Freedom Rider and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What happened in 1954? Answer: Timmons moved to New York in 1954. Question: What did he do in New York?

This picture captures the moment an over-confident burglar grinned behind the wheel of a luxury convertible he had just helped to steal. Ashley Jordan has been jailed for two years after police used the photo to help link him to the theft of the Saab as well as a BMW and £26,000 of goods stolen from a couple's home as they slept. The 22-year-old kept the incriminating images on a memory stick, which he desperately tried to flush down the toilet when police raided his home in Leeds. 'Arrogant': Ashley Jordan sitting behind the wheel of a Saab convertible he had just helped to steal . Jordan wept in Leeds Crown Court yesterday as he was sentenced to two years in prison for the thefts. The court heard that he was a member of gang who targeted a house in the suburb of Barwick-in-Elmet on March 19 last year. They removed the lock on the door and took the keys to a BMW and Saab convertible as the couple who lived there slept upstairs. The gang also stole cash, a 60-inch television and iPhones, with the total value of the goods adding up to £26,000. Caught: Police used this BMW's licence plate to link it to a burglary from a house in a suburb of Leeds . Police visited Jordan's house after he was seen trying to carry the giant TV inside. When they arrived, they found Jordan trying to discard a memory stick in the toilet, according to the prosecution, but officers managed to retrieve the data. Images on the stick showed Jordan posing with the two vehicles, which police were able to link back to the burglary thanks to the number plate on the BMW - which has not been recovered. Jordan told officers his friends had decided to carry out the burglary after they spent the evening in the pub. He claimed he did not take part in the raid, but admitted helping to move stolen items afterwards. Jordan pleaded guilty to burglary and two offences of theft. His lawyer said in court that he was ashamed of his actions, and no longer associated with the other members of the gang. After the sentencing, a police spokesman said: 'The incriminating images that led to Jordan being caught illustrate the arrogance and disregard for the victims that burglars like him have. 'They proved to be very useful in linking him to the crime and we are grateful to him for inadvertently providing such valuable evidence.'

{"question": "In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage.   What did the two languages have in common?, Context: The strength of the Viking influence on Old English appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the language - pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like \"hence\" and \"together\"), conjunctions and prepositions - show the most marked Danish influence; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for, as Jespersen indicates, no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most “important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.” This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in “simplifying English grammar.”", "answer": "some words"}
{"question": "Title: Julian Huxley Background: Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS (22 June 1887 - 14 February 1975) was a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund and the first President of the British Humanist Association. Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. Section: Secular humanism Passage: Huxley's humanism came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: \"The critical point in the evolution of man... was when he acquired the use of [language]... Man's development is potentially open... He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which... largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change\". Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics. (see evolutionary ethics) Huxley's views on god could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.  Huxley had a close association with the British rationalist and secular humanist movements. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1927 until his death, and on the formation of the British Humanist Association in 1963 became its first President, to be succeeded by AJ Ayer in 1965. He was also closely involved with the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Many of Huxley's books address humanist themes. In 1962 Huxley accepted the American Humanist Association's annual \"Humanist of the Year\" award.  Huxley also presided over the founding Congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union and served with John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann on the founding advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York.

{"question": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

The posts are \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and they are \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'   CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : My roommate’s sister is staying with us during the weekends in January for work. Originally it was supposed to just be one weekend, but it turned into every weekend, and my roommate never asked me if it was okay or even told me the plan until I asked him. They are really loud together, and his sister sleeps all day in the living room, making it hard for me to do normal things without waking her up like cook, watch TV, clean, etc. Because she sleeps all day, she is constantly loud at night or in the early morning which is annoying because the weekends are my only days to sleep in.   His sister is bringing her 6-month old baby with her next weekend, and again, I was never asked if this was okay. They are planning on staying for 4 days instead of just Saturday and Sunday.   My roommate and I adopted a kitten last week (mutually agreed upon decision, he does not belong to just me or just my roommate) and he has been saying that the cat needs to be kept in the bathroom or my bedroom while the baby is here. We live in a small, 2BR apartment and the bathroom is TINY. We kept him in there for the first few days that we had him so we could litter train him, but now he’s a free-roamer because we know he won’t have accidents or scratch our stuff. He is still a kitten though, so he has a TON of energy and is still doing things like pouncing on feet and swatting at hands.   Understandably they don’t want the kitten to scratch the baby, but I feel like it’s unfair to my cat (and to me) to confine him to one area. I would need to either move his litter box into my bedroom (gross) or lock him in the bathroom  (cruel), and I don’t plan on doing either of these things. I’m fine with HELPING to control the cat, but ultimately I feel it is their responsibility to keep the baby away from the cat. AITA?", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "Title: A Night at the Opera (Queen album) Background: A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. Section: \"Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)\" Passage: \"Death on Two Legs\" can be referred to as Freddie Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975. Sheffield denied the allegations in his 2013 autobiography entitled \"Life on Two Legs: Set The Record Straight\", and referred to copies of the original 1972 management contracts between Sheffield and Queen, which were included in the book as proof of his defence. Though the song never makes direct reference to him, after listening to a playback of the song at Trident Studios during the time of album release, Sheffield was appalled, and sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song.  During live performances, Mercury would usually rededicate the song to \"a real motherfucker of a gentleman\", although this line was censored on the version that appeared on their Live Killers album in 1979. Other than on the live album, he said it was dedicated to a \"motherfucker I used to know\".  In the Classic Albums documentary about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat taken aback at first by the bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being \"so vindictive that he [May] felt bad singing it\". After the song came together, it was agreed that the \"author should have his way\", and the song was recorded as written.  As with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", most of the guitar parts on this song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how they needed to be played on guitar. \"Death on Two Legs\" remained on the setlist until, and well into, The Game Tour in 1980, and was then dropped. However, the piano introduction was played during the Hot Space and Works tours. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what is Death on two legs? Answer: Death on Two Legs\" can be referred to as Freddie Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, Question: why was he angry with Norman? Answer: some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager Question: what are some of the lyrics? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: What is an important fact regarding the song? Answer: Sheffield denied the allegations in his 2013 autobiography entitled \"Life on Two Legs: Set The Record Straight\", Question: how did the band feel about the song? Answer: Sheffield was appalled, and sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, Question: what was the verdict?", "answer": "resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song."}

{"question": "Title: William McKinley Background: William McKinley (January 29, 1843 - September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. Section: Early life and family Passage: William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (nee Allison) McKinley (1809-1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County.  The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.  In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio. CANNOTANSWER  Question: where does he grow up Answer: The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, Question: did he have any siblings?

He grew up in the city of Monongahela, a coal mining town 25 miles (40 km) south of Pittsburgh. His maternal grandparents, Vincenzo \"James\" Bavuso and Josephine Savarino Bavuso, were both Italian immigrants. Section: 1993-1994 Passage: Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in April 1993. His trade, along with the free-agent signing of star Los Angeles Raiders running back Marcus Allen to the Chiefs, generated much media attention and excitement in Kansas City.  The Chiefs mailed three jerseys to Montana. One was number 3, his number from Notre Dame which the Chiefs had retired in honor of Hall of Fame kicker Jan Stenerud, who offered to let him wear it. Another was number 19, which he wore in youth football and also briefly in training camp of the 1979 season with San Francisco, and the third was number 16, which Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson offered to let Montana wear since the organization had retired it. Montana declined Dawson's and Stenerud's offers and wore 19 instead and signed a $10 million contract over three years.  Montana was injured for part of the 1993 season, but was still selected to his final Pro Bowl and led the Chiefs in two come-from-behind wins in the 1993 playoffs, reaching the AFC Championship Game where Kansas City lost to the Buffalo Bills. In their Wild Card win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, he threw a 7-yard fourth down touchdown pass to send the game into overtime. Then against the Houston Oilers, he led the team to 28 second half points, including three touchdown passes to earn the 29th fourth quarter comeback win of his career. Including their two playoff victories that year (the Chiefs only had one prior playoff win since 1970 Super Bowl IV), the 1993 Chiefs won 13 games, tying the franchise record for wins in a season.  Montana returned healthy to the Chiefs in 1994, starting all but two games. His highlights included a classic duel with John Elway (which Montana won, 31-28) on Monday Night Football, and a memorable game in week 2 when Montana played against his old team, the 49ers and Steve Young. In a much-anticipated match-up, Montana and the Chiefs prevailed and defeated the 49ers, 24-17. Montana led his team to a final playoff appearance in 1994.

Sent 6: In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. Sent 7: England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. Sent 8: The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic.

{"question": "In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context.   Context: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) inhibit the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) by mechanisms that remain poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the signaling mechanisms by which CCBs inhibit VSMC migration.', 'Nifedipine potently inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced chemotaxis, collagen I-induced haptotaxis, and wound-induced migration of human aortic VSMC. In addition, nifedipine inhibited PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and lamellipodium formation. PDGF-induced VSMC migration was significantly inhibited by PP2, a selective inhibitor of the Src kinase family, and was also significantly inhibited by the expression of kinase-inactive Src, suggesting that Src is required for VSMC migration. Nifedipine also inhibited PDGF-induced Src activation (by 60+/-4% with 30 microM) and tyrosinephosphorylation of Cas, paxillin, and cortactin, which are actin-associated substrates of Src. RNA interference-induced knockdown of the Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, resulted in inhibition of PDGF-induced Src activation and migration. Finally, nifedipine inhibited PDGF-induced Pyk2 activation in a dose-dependent manner.\\Question: Does nifedipine interfere with migration of vascular smooth muscle cells via inhibition of Pyk2-Src axis?", "answer": "These data suggest that nifedipine interferes with VSMC migration via inhibition of the Pyk2-Src axis and inhibition of actin remodeling processes, including membrane ruffling and lamellipodium formation."}

{"question": "Title: Andrea Bocelli Background: Bocelli was born to Alessandro and Edi Bocelli. Doctors had advised Bocelli's parents to abort Bocelli before birth as they predicted, based on studies, that Bocelli would be born with a disability. It was evident at birth that Bocelli had numerous problems with his sight, and after visits to many doctors, he was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma. Bocelli has stated that his mother's decision to give birth to him and overrule the doctor's advice was the inspiration for him to oppose abortion. Section: Voice Passage: Italian spinto tenor Franco Corelli praised Bocelli's voice after hearing it for the first time during a master class in 1986, in Turin, and he later gave Bocelli private lessons.  Puerto Rican soprano Ana Maria Martinez, who regularly performs with Bocelli, said, \"More than anything, Andrea has something that is unique in that he brings this light that is always around him. And this purity of heart and beauty of sound just touches the listener. It can't be described.\"  Celine Dion said while introducing him during her Christmas Special for These Are Special Times, in 1998, that \"if God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli,\" and David Foster, a producer of the album, often describes Bocelli's voice as the most beautiful in the world. Similarly, Jazz singer, Al Jarreau, who performed with Bocelli on the \"Night of the Proms\" tour in Europe, in 1995, described him as \"the most beautiful voice in the world,\" and American talk show host Oprah Winfrey commented on her talk show that, \"when I hear Andrea sing, I burst into tears.\" After attending Bocelli's concert at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009, British-American actress Elizabeth Taylor said, \"My mind, my soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being. God has kissed this man and I thank God for it.\" Taylor had been a passionate fan of Bocelli's since the beginning of his music career in the mid-1990s. Other fans include Prince Albert of Monaco, who invited the tenor to sing at his wedding, as well as Sarah, Duchess of York, and actress Isabella Rossellini.

Zhao was beheaded in December 1911 by pro-Republican forces. The bulk of the area that was historically known as Kham was now claimed to be the Xikang Administrative District, created by the Republican revolutionaries. By the end of 1912, the last Manchu troops were forced out of Tibet through India. Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been residing. When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the spiritual and political leadership of Tibet.

This plastic water bottle is fitted with a Nasa-inspired filtration system so powerful it can turn cola into clear, colourless liquid, the manufacturers claim. ÖKO's 'advanced filtration water bottle' draws on technology originally developed by Nasa to ensure the drinker's every sip is 'pure, fresh and clean'. This video footage of the bottle being put to the test shows it being filled with brown Coca Cola which, after being poured through the special filter cap, looks exactly like water. Scroll down for video . The raw ingredients: A plastic water bottle with a filtration system, and a bottle of coke . The water bottle with a filter developed from Nasa technology is filled with Coke as the experiment progresses . The coke is miraculously turned into what appears to be water by the filter . The finished drink: The resulting liquid was described as 'like sugar water' VIDEO: Watch the Nasa-inspired water filtration system in action . The manufacturer used a video demonstrating the effect of the filter on cola on its website, but a tester for rocketnews24.com decided to check out the results for himself. The footage of the experiment shows how his trial using his own ÖKO bottle yielded the same results at first. 'The first streams of liquid were completely colourless, but became tinged with brown as I continued to pour,' his report said. 'I was a little disappointed that it wasn't completely colourless, but pressed on. 'I took a sip and was again disappointed to find that it wasn't tasteless,' said the tester, who added that it tasted 'like sugar water'. The Coca Cola experiment on the OKO website is aimed at illustrating the effectiveness of the bottle, which is designed to filter water, not other drinks. The eco-friendly water container comes in three different filtration levels. The Level-1 filter is carbon based and designed to reduce chlorine and odour from tap water. Powerful: The filtration system used for the plastic water containers was inspired by Nasa technology . The Level-2 filter contains more than 400 tiny pores and uses a positively charged electro-absorption process to trap harmful agents as water passes through it. According to the manufacturer, charge fields activated upon contact with water virtually close the pore to any intruding agents. 'Using built-in silver ions, the material then kills bacteria upon contact,' the OKO website says. The third level of filtration is designed for the treatment of known elements in large volumes of water in extreme environments. Level-3 is not available to buy at retail.

{"question": "Title: Children of Bodom Background: Children of Bodom is a Finnish extreme metal band from Espoo. Formed in 1993, the group consists of Alexi Laiho (Lead vocals, guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppala (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (guitar). They have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD. The band's third studio album, Follow the Reaper, was their first album to receive a Gold certification in Finland, and subsequent studio albums have acquired the same status. Section: Hate Crew Deathroll (2002-2004) Passage: In February 2002, Children of Bodom began writing songs for their upcoming album, entitled Hate Crew Deathroll. They returned to Astia-studio (Lappeenranta, Finland) to work with producer Anssi Kippo again. The session ensued during the months of August and September, and the album was released January 2003 in Finland. It remained on the top of the Finnish charts for a total of three weeks and subsequently became the band's first gold album. Eventually all of the band's albums reached this status and Follow the Reaper reached platinum.  On 3 January 2003, the Finnish Metal Music Awards were held at Tavastia Club in Helsinki. Voting was open to all the metal fans and was presented through the various media outlets that were working with the event's organizers. Children of Bodom was awarded Finnish Band of the Year.  Children of Bodom's first world tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the consolidation of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons right in the middle of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, \"Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend.\" Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Is Hate Crew Deathroll an album ?

{"question": "Title: Holland Smith Background: Holland Smith was born on April 20, 1882 in Hatchechubbee, Alabama to John V. Smith and his wife Cornelia Caroline McTyeire. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for a year. Section: World War II Passage: After the latter assignment, General Smith assumed command of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, taking that unit to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for extended amphibious training in October 1940. In February 1941, when the brigade was redesignated the U.S. 1st Marine Division, he became that organization's first commander. He returned with the division to Quantico in April 1941, and in June of that year he was detached from it to take command of the organization that eventually became the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. Under this command, the 1st Marine Division and the 1st and 9th Army Divisions received their initial training in amphibious warfare.  Moving to San Diego in August 1942, the general took command of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, under which he completed the amphibious indoctrination of the 2d and 3d Marine Divisions before they went overseas, and the 7th Army Division and other units involved in the Aleutians operation. The Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, was later redesignated the V Amphibious Corps, and in September 1943, as commander of that unit, General Smith arrived at Pearl Harbor to begin planning for the Gilbert Islands campaign. He continued to head the V Amphibious Corps until August 1944, when he was named Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, at Pearl Harbor. Subsequently, he commanded the Fleet Marine Force. In addition to that post, he commanded Task Force 56 in the Battle of Iwo Jima before returning to the United States in July 1945, to head the Marine Training and Replacement Command at Camp Pendleton, California. Holland was known for the quote \"In our corps without responsibility and discipline we would not have won the Battle of Iwo Jima.\"  U.S. Navy Admirals Raymond Spruance and Richmond Turner wanted General Smith to command the Okinawa invasion forces. They were overruled by CinCPac, Admiral Nimitz because General Smith had sacked a U.S. Army General, Ralph Smith, during the Saipan campaign, and justifiable animosity between senior U.S. Army staff existed towards General Smith due to his service chauvinism. U.S. Army General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. was appointed to command the Okinawa invasion in his place. Coincidentally, General Roy Geiger USMC, was placed in command of Tenth Army in June, 1945 when General Buckner was killed in Action. CANNOTANSWER  Question: what did he do in WWII?

{"question": "Title: Johan Galtung Background: Johan Vincent Galtung (born 24 October 1930) is a Norwegian sociologist, mathematician, and the principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies. He was the main founder of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) in 1959 and served as its first director until 1970. He also established the Journal of Peace Research in 1964. In 1969 he was appointed to the world's first chair in peace and conflict studies, at the University of Oslo. Section: The US as a republic and empire Passage: For Johan Galtung, the US is simultaneously a republic and an empire, a distinction he believes is highly relevant. The US is on one hand loved for its republican qualities, and on the other loathed by its enemies abroad for its perceived military aggressions. Its republican qualities include its work ethic and dynamism, productivity and creativity, the idea of freedom, or liberty, and a pioneering spirit. On the other hand, its military and political manipulation are censured for their aggressiveness, arrogance, violence, hypocrisy and self-righteousness, as well as the US public ignorance of other cultures and extreme materialism.  In 1973, Galtung criticised the \"structural fascism\" of the US and other Western countries that make war to secure materials and markets, stating: \"Such an economic system is called capitalism, and when it's spread in this way to other countries it's called imperialism\", and has praised Fidel Castro for \"break[ing] free of imperialism's iron grip\". Galtung has stated that the US is a \"killer country\" guilty of \"neo-fascist state terrorism\" and compared the US to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.  According to Galtung, the US empire causes \"unbearable suffering and resentment\" because the \"exploiters/ killers/ dominators/ alienators, and those who support the US Empire because of perceived benefits\" are engaging in \"unequal, non-sustainable, exchange patterns\". In an article published in 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will \"decline and fall\" by 2020. He expanded on this hypothesis in his 2009 book titled The Fall of the US Empire - and Then What? Successors, Regionalization or Globalization? US Fascism or US Blossoming?.  However, the decline of the US empire did not imply a decline of the US republic, and the \"relief from the burden of Empire control and maintenance...could lead to a blossoming of the US Republic\". Elaborating on the radio and television program Democracy Now, he stated that he loved the American republic and hated the American empire. He added that many Americans had thanked him for this statement on his lecture tours, because it helped them resolve the conflict between their love for their country and their displeasure with its foreign policy. CANNOTANSWER  Question: What did Galtung think about the US? Answer: For Johan Galtung, the US is simultaneously a republic and an empire, a distinction he believes is highly relevant. Question: Can you explain this distinction? Answer: The US is on one hand loved for its republican qualities, and on the other loathed by its enemies abroad for its perceived military aggressions. Question: Did Galtung write anything about the US? Answer: In an article published in 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will \"decline and fall\" by 2020. He expanded on this hypothesis in his 2009 book Question: What was the title of his 2009 book? Answer: 2009 book titled The Fall of the US Empire - and Then What?

{"question": "Title: Émilie du Châtelet Background: Gabrielle Emilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise Du Chatelet (French pronunciation: [emili dy Satle] ( listen); 17 December 1706  - 10 September 1749) was a French natural philosopher, mathematician, physicist, and author during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to childbirth in 1749. Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's book Principia containing basic laws of physics. The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation today. Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics--the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element. Section: Early education Passage: Du Chatelet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty.  Among their acquaintances was Fontenelle, the perpetual secretary of the French Academie des Sciences. Du Chatelet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old. Du Chatelet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women. While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of Emilie's intellectual curiosity, there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of Du Chatelet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.  In either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status. When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her. As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science. Her mother Gabrielle-Anne was horrified at her progress and fought Louis-Nicolas at every step, once attempting to have Emilie sent to a convent.  Du Chatelet's also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Where did she go to school? Answer: Du Chatelet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty. Question: Did she have a mentor or tutor? Answer: Du Chatelet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old. Question: Who else did she learn from? Answer: her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her. Question: How did she get started in philosophy? Answer: by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. Question: Any other famous philosophers she worked with? Answer: CANNOTANSWER Question: Did she ever attend a formal school?

{"question": "An investor who is bullish about a stock may wish to construct a bull spread for that stock. One way to construct such a spread is to buy a call with strke price $K_1$ and sell a call with the same expiration date but with a strike price of $K_2 > K_1$. If we draw the payoff curve for that a spread, the initial cost of the spread would be negative is this True? Answer True or False. Relevant Theorem: Options Theory refers to the study and understanding of options, which are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date. Options are used for various purposes, such as hedging, speculation, and income generation. The two main types of options are call options and put options.  Call options give the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset at a specified price (called the strike price) on or before the expiration date. If the market price of the asset rises above the strike price, the buyer can exercise the option and buy the asset at the lower strike price, making a profit. If the market price remains below the strike price, the buyer can let the option expire, and their loss is limited to the premium paid for the option.  Put options give the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date. If the market price of the asset falls below the strike price, the buyer can exercise the option and sell the asset at the higher strike price, making a profit. If the market price remains above the strike price, the buyer can let the option expire, and their loss is limited to the premium paid for the option.  Options Theory involves understanding the factors that influence the pricing of options, such as the current market price of the underlying asset, the strike price, the time until expiration, the volatility of the underlying asset, and the risk-free interest rate. The Black-Scholes model is a widely used mathematical model for pricing options, which takes these factors into account.  Options Theory also includes the study of various trading strategies involving options, such as covered calls, protective puts, straddles, and spreads. These strategies can be used to generate income, protect an existing investment, or speculate on the future price movement of an asset.  In summary, Options Theory is the study of options as financial derivatives, including their pricing, characteristics, and various trading strategies. It is an essential aspect of modern finance and plays a crucial role in risk management and investment decision-making.", "answer": "False"}
{"question": "Title: Whitney Houston Background: Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 - February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston is one of the best-selling music artists of all-time, with 200 million records sold worldwide. She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold certification. Section: Death and funeral Passage: Houston reportedly appeared \"disheveled\" and \"erratic\" in the days immediately prior to her death. On Thursday, February 9, 2012, Houston visited singers Brandy and Monica, together with Clive Davis, at their rehearsals for Davis' pre-Grammy Awards party at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills. That same day, she made her last public performance when she joined Kelly Price on stage in Hollywood, California and sang \"Jesus Loves Me\".  Two days later, on February 11, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly Hills paramedics arrived at approximately 3:30 p.m., found the singer unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. PST. The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were \"no obvious signs of criminal intent\". On March 22, 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the \"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\". The office stated the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly before her death. Toxicology results revealed additional drugs in her system: diphenhydramine (Benadryl), alprazolam (Xanax), cannabis and cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril). The manner of death was listed as an \"accident\".  An invitation-only memorial service was held for Houston on Saturday, February 18, 2012, at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. The service was scheduled for two hours, but lasted four. Among those who performed at the funeral were Stevie Wonder (rewritten version of \"Ribbon in the Sky\", and \"Love's in Need of Love Today\"), CeCe Winans (\"Don't Cry\", and \"Jesus Loves Me\"), Alicia Keys (\"Send Me an Angel\"), Kim Burrell (rewritten version of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"), and R. Kelly (\"I Look to You\"). The performances were interspersed with hymns by the church choir and remarks by Clive Davis, Houston's record producer; Kevin Costner; Rickey Minor, her music director; her cousin, Dionne Warwick; and Ray Watson, her security guard for the past 11 years. Aretha Franklin was listed on the program and was expected to sing, but was unable to attend the service. Bobby Brown, Houston's ex-husband, was also invited to the funeral but he left shortly after the service began. Houston was buried on February 19, 2012, in Fairview Cemetery, in Westfield, New Jersey, next to her father, John Russell Houston, who died in 2003. In June 2012, the McDonald's Gospelfest in Newark became a tribute to Houston. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did Whitney die? Answer: on February 11, Question: How did she die?

{"question": "Title: The Wildhearts Background: The Wildhearts are an English rock group, formed in 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as The Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. However, this characterization is denied by the band, who see their influences as being far broader, as shown in the song \"29 X The Pain\", which lists many of group leader Ginger's influences. Despite several top 20 singles and one top 10 album in Britain, the Wildhearts have not achieved major commercial success, owing in part to difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to recreational drugs and depression. Section: Follow-up Passage: The Wildhearts next planned a double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the recording sessions. Instead the band released a collection of six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track \"Geordie In Wonderland\". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with Wolfsbane's Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included \"If Life Is Like A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft\", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic \"Sky Babies.\" Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play \"Sky Babies\" at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.  The second album proper was to be known as P.H.U.Q.. Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger (in a move he later claimed to regret) fired guitarist CJ, and some of the album's tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. P.H.U.Q. was released in May 1995 and reached   Question: What was the follow-up? Answer: The Wildhearts next planned a double album, Question: When did they release this album?

{"question": "Article: By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 05:05 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:50 EST, 19 October 2012 . AA patrolmen are now being trained as plumbers under new plans which could see them unblocking toilets when they are not jump starting cars. It is part of a trial which was launched in Northern Ireland over summer. The scheme aims to boost the AA’s home repair service, and could be rolled out across the UK following a trial over the summer in Northern Ireland. But the move has been branded a cost-cutting exercise by unions. Plumbing patrol: AA patrolmen are being trained as plumbers to boost their home repair service . The plan comes after reports that AA, one of Britain’s best known brands, could soon be up for sale for about £5 billion. Acromas, owner of the 107-year-old . motoring organisation, has appointed accountants Ernst & Young to . look at options for the sale which is not expected to start until early . next year. Patrols as plumbers has the potential to be introduced in other parts of the UK, Operations Manager Keith Munns said. According to The Sun, an internal memo from Mr Munns said: ‘We have trained up a number of roadside patrols to carry out basic plumbing activity. For sale: The plans comes after reports that AA, one of Britain's most iconic brands, could soon be up for sale for about £5¿billion . ‘By the time we get to winter we will . know whether that has worked and it may well be that we have rolled . that out a little bit further.’ The plumbers training is designed to . strengthen AA’s Home Emergency Repair service which launched two years . ago promising ‘trusted and skilled tradesmen’ that can fix leaks, burst . pipes and toilets in the home. But Paul Grafton of GMB union said: ‘This is all about money.’ Earlier this month, the company . announced that they expected more than 400 jobs to be lost at the AA . call centre in Cardiff, blaming the rise in online transactions. Some 3,000 staff left the company in 2004 during the restructure of AA when it was sold by Centrica, the company that runs British Gas, to CVC and Permira. Acromas was then formed in 2007 when the AA . merged with Saga, an over-50s insurance, financial services, holidays and healthcare specialist. Since then, the AA has grown . from around 7,000 to 8,500 employees. The Automobile Association (AA) formed in 1905 when a group of motoring enthusiasts met at the Trocadero restaurant in London’s West End. The group initially intended to champion the motorist’s cause and help drivers avoid police speed traps. The AA’s 100 members in 1905 grew to 83,000 by 1914. The first AA patrols used basic pedal cycles and had no uniforms. They patrolled Brighton and Portsmouth roads where their official duties were ‘indicating dangers on the road and helping motorists who had broken down’. In 1907 the first AA insurance policy was launched and by 1912 AA was inspecting and classifying hotels. The AA then opened the first roadside filling station in 1920 at Aldermaston in Berkshire and by 1932 they opened ten more. With the introduction of the two-way radio after WWII, the night-time breakdown service was launched in 1949. In 1950 the AA hit the one million members milestone. An advertising campaign in the 1990s branded the AA the fourth emergency service. The AA joined the Centrica group, the company that runs British Gas, in a £1.1billion acquisition in 1999 before its acquisition by private equity firms CVC and Permira for £1.75billion.

Article: Thoughts claim our attention continuously, and waste our time and energy on unimportant and useless matters. They actually rule our life. We have become so used to this slavery, that we take it for granted, and have become unconscious of this habit, except on certain occasions. While breathing, we do not need to pay attention to each inhalation and exhalation. We become conscious of the process of breathing only when we have some difficulty with breathing, such as when our nose is blocked, due to a cold, or when we are in an unventilated  room. It is the same with thinking. We become conscious of the constant onslaught of our thoughts, and of our inability to calm them down, only when we need to concentrate, solve a problem or study. We are also aware of them when we have worries or fears. Look at the following familiar situation. You need to study something for an exam. You sit comfortably on the sofa with the book in your hands and start reading. After a while you feel hungry and go to the kitchen to eat something. You return to read, and then hear your people talking outside. You listen to them for several moments and then bring your attention back to the book. After a while you feel restless and switch on the radio to listen to some music. You continue to read for a little while, and then remember something that happened yesterday, and you start thinking about it. When you look at your watch, you are amazed to find out that one complete hour has passed and you have hardly read anything. And at this time, you feel you're thinking. This is what happens when one lacks concentration. Imagine what you could have accomplished if you could control your attention and focus your mind!   Question: When can you feel you are thinking?

She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed throughout the TV series by Alyson Hannigan. Willow plays an integral role within the inner circle of friends--called the Scooby Gang--who support Buffy Summers, a teenager gifted with superhuman powers to defeat vampires, demons, and other evil in the fictional town of Sunnydale. The series begins as Buffy, Willow, and their friend Xander are in 10th grade and Willow is a shy, nerdy girl with little confidence. Section: Season 7 Passage: The seventh season starts with Willow in England, unnerved by her power, studying with a coven near Giles' home to harness it. She fears returning to Sunnydale and what she is capable of doing if she loses control again, a fear that dogs her the whole season.  Buffy and the Scoobies face the First Evil, bent on ending the Slayer line and destroying the world. Potential Slayers from around the globe congregate at Buffy's home and she trains them to battle the First Evil. Willow continues to face her grief over Tara's death and, reluctantly, becomes involved with one of the Potentials, Kennedy (Iyari Limon).  In the final episode of the series, \"Chosen\", Buffy calls upon Willow to perform the most powerful spell she has ever attempted. With Kennedy nearby, cautioned to kill her if she becomes out of control, Willow infuses every Potential Slayer in the world with the same powers Buffy and Faith have.

Willow is able to escape with Buffy, Xander, Giles, and Kennedy as Sunnydale is destroyed.  Through the gamut of changes Willow endures in the series, Buffy studies scholar Ian Shuttleworth states that Alyson Hannigan's performances are the reason for Willow's popularity: \"Hannigan can play on audience heartstrings like a concert harpist...

Now he has decided to change his hairstyle as he prepares for a series of interviews for a job as a lecturer. Hair we go: Timothy Price models his long ginger locks (left) and shows the remarkable transformation following his first hair cut in a decade (right) When his hair was all gone, Timothy pledged to put the remains to good use and has placed an advertisement on Gumtree appealing for anyone looking for a wig. The dad-of-two said: 'I started growing my hair in university, which is pretty normal and then I got used to it and I enjoyed the change of hairstyle. 'I thought I would smarten up for any job interviews I may have. I thought it would be a fresh start. 'I wasn’t nervous when I got it cut, I was just ready for a change and wanted something different.

{"question": "Title: Alan Kulwicki Background: Kulwicki grew up in Greenfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee known for its Polish-American neighborhoods, near the Milwaukee Mile racetrack. After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Section: Early racing career Passage: Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. \"I showed him how\", Gerry Kulwicki said. \"And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'\"  Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models - the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level - at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh.  Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer, and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships.  In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions. CANNOTANSWER  Question: when did Alan start racing? Answer: Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. Question: who made the karts for him?

{"question": "Title: Cass Sunstein Background: Cass Robert Sunstein FBA (born September 21, 1954) is an American legal scholar, particularly in the fields of constitutional law, administrative law, environmental law, and law and behavioral economics, who was the Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2012. For 27 years, Sunstein taught at the University of Chicago Law School. Sunstein is the Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard Law School. He is Honorary Doctor at Copenhagen Business School. Section: \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration Passage: Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\" They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\", where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\" They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as \"extremist groups.\"  The authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\"  Sunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\" Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\" This position has been criticized by some commentators who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens. Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.

{"question": "Title: Sophie Tucker Background: Tucker was born Sofya \"Sonya\" Kalish (in Russian, Sof'ia <<Sonia>> Kalish) in 1887 to a Jewish family en route to America from Tulchyn, Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. (\"Sonya\" is a nickname for the name \"Sofya\", the Russian form of the name Sophie.) The family adopted the surname Abuza, settled in Hartford, Connecticut, and opened a restaurant. At a young age, she began singing at her parents' restaurant for tips. Section: Stage Passage: In 1907, Tucker made her first theater appearance, singing at an amateur night in a vaudeville establishment. It was here that she was first made to wear blackface during performance, as her producers thought that the crowd would tease her for being \"so big and ugly.\" By 1908, she had joined a burlesque show in Pittsburgh but was ashamed to tell her family that she was performing in a deep southern accent wearing burnt cork on her face. While touring later that year, luggage including her makeup kit was lost, and Tucker was allowed to go on stage without the blackface.  She then stunned the crowd by saying, \"You all can see I'm a white girl. Well, I'll tell you something more: I'm not Southern. I'm a Jewish girl and I just learned this Southern accent doing a blackface act for two years. And now, Mr. Leader, please play my song.\" Tucker also began integrating \"fat girl\" humor, which became a common thread in her acts. Her songs included \"I Don't Want to Get Thin\" and \"Nobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love.\"  In 1909, at the age of 22, Tucker performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. Though she was a hit, the other female stars refused to share the spotlight with her, and the company was forced to let her go. This caught the attention of William Morris, a theater owner and future founder of the William Morris Agency, which would become one of the largest and most powerful talent agencies of the era. Two years later, Tucker released \"Some of These Days\" on Edison Records, written by Shelton Brooks. The title of the song was later used as the title of Tucker's 1945 biography.  In 1921, Tucker hired pianist and songwriter Ted Shapiro as her accompanist and musical director, a position he would keep throughout her career. Besides writing a number of songs for her, Shapiro became part of her stage act, playing piano on stage while she sang, and exchanging banter and wisecracks with her in between numbers. Tucker remained a popular singer through the 1920s and became friends with stars such as Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters, who introduced her to jazz. Tucker learned from these talented women and became one of the first performers to introduce jazz to white vaudeville audiences.  In 1925, Jack Yellen wrote one of her most famous songs, \"My Yiddishe Momme\". The song was performed in large American cities where there were sizable Jewish audiences. Tucker explained, \"Even though I loved the song and it was a sensational hit every time I sang it, I was always careful to use it only when I knew the majority of the house would understand Yiddish. However, you didn't have to be a Jew to be moved by My Yiddishe Momme.\" During the Hitler regime, the song was banned by the German government for evoking Jewish culture. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did Sophie Tucker first take the stage? Answer: In 1907, Question: In what performance did she perform in?

{"question": "Title: Anton Rubinstein Background: Anton Grigorevich Rubinstein (Russian: Anton Grigor'evich Rubinshtein, tr. Anton Grigorevich Rubinshteyn; November 28 [O.S. November 16] 1829 - November 20 [O.S. November 8] 1894) was a Russian pianist, composer and conductor who became a pivotal figure in Russian culture when he founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He was the elder brother of Nikolai Rubinstein who founded the Moscow Conservatory. As a pianist, Rubinstein ranks among the great 19th-century keyboard virtuosos. Section: The American tour Passage: By 1867, ongoing tensions with the Balakirev camp, along with related matters, led to intense dissension within the Conservatory's faculty. Rubinstein resigned and returned to touring throughout Europe. Unlike his previous tours, he began increasingly featuring the works of other composers. In previous tours, Rubinstein had played primarily his own works.  At the behest of the Steinway & Sons piano company, Rubinstein toured the United States during the 1872-3 season. Steinway's contract with Rubinstein called on him to give 200 concerts at the then unheard-of rate of 200 dollars per concert (payable in gold--Rubinstein distrusted both United States banks and United States paper money), plus all expenses paid. Rubinstein stayed in America 239 days, giving 215 concerts--sometimes two and three a day in as many cities.  Rubinstein wrote of his American experience,  May Heaven preserve us from such slavery! Under these conditions there is no chance for art--one simply grows into an automaton, performing mechanical work; no dignity remains to the artist; he is lost.... The receipts and the success were invariably gratifying, but it was all so tedious that I began to despise myself and my art. So profound was my dissatisfaction that when several years later I was asked to repeat my American tour, I refused pointblank...  Despite his misery, Rubinstein made enough money from his American tour to give him financial security for the rest of his life. Upon his return to Russia, he \"hastened to invest in real estate\", purchasing a dacha in Peterhof, not far from Saint Petersburg, for himself and his family. CANNOTANSWER  Question: When did Rubinstein go on his American tour? Answer: At the behest of the Steinway & Sons piano company, Rubinstein toured the United States during the 1872-3 season.

The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.

The survey quizzed 620 women on who they thought had the most stylish bump from a list of famous faces. Hot on Holly’s heels was Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh who’s due to have her first baby later on this year. Scroll down for video . Holly Willoughby, (pictured left with This Morning co-host Phillip Schofield), tends to opt for chic and comfortable options to see her through her pregnancy in style - a strategy that has won her many fans . Kimberley Walsh, who came second in the poll, gently patted her baby bump as she arrived at BBC Breakfast in Manchester on Monday . Not to be outdone by her sister, Kourtney Kardashian has been looking particularly stylish during her third pregnancy . The pop star picked up 21 per cent of the vote and was praised for her stylish, body-con maternity wear. American socialite Kourtney Kardashian, who’s pregnant with her third child, came third in the poll, with 15 per cent of the vote. She was followed by TOWIE star Billie Faiers, who’s due to give birth to her first baby with partner Greg Shepherd in July, with 14 per cent of the women agreeing she had the most stylish bump. US movie star Mila Kunis came in at fifth place with nine per cent of the vote. The women questioned loved her relaxed maternity style.

Now normally I would feel really guilty for making it about me but I don't think he is telling the truth and here's why:  - this is the second time something has come up when we are supposed to go on a date  - when I confirmed our date a few days ago he said \"plan on it for now\". For now? Makes it seem like he was planning on bailing. - we had hardly talked in the past several days - it sounds like something a catfish would say (note: we met online and have yet to meet in person)  So AITA? Am I being paranoid?", "answer": "blocking a guy after his dad was in a car accident"}

{"question": "Article: (CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the Obama administration to release 28 videotapes purportedly showing forced feedings and other confinement measures of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba. Judge Gladys Kessler ruled Friday the tapes can be released with modifications -- such as blurring faces -- to address the government's concerns over identifying guards, uniforms, and written materials on walls. \"Given what is already available to the public and known to the detainees, it simply is not plausible to argue that release of the videos will give rise to an additional probability of harm by encouraging the development of FCE [forced cell extractions] countermeasures,\" Kessler said in the ruling. Lawyers for a Syrian man held at Guantanamo since 2002, whose approved release is still pending, were lobbying for the release of the videos ahead of a hearing scheduled for Monday. Abu Wa'el Dhiab, 43, has been on numerous hunger strikes while in detention. He and his lawyers are seeking a preliminary injunction preventing detention facility officials from forced cell extractions [FCE], and placing him in a so-called restraint chair used for forced feedings. U.S. Navy nurse won't force-feed Guantanamo detainees . The method is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach. Several media organizations -- including the Associated Press, NPR, The New York Times and Dow Jones -- had also filed a separate brief urging the release of the tapes, which show forced feedings of Dhiab and others. The Justice Department had expressed concern about national security or other sensitive information being inadvertently revealed in open court and requested a closed hearing, but Kessler strongly dismissed the arguments and denied the request. \"This Court has full faith in the ability of counsel and the court, acting together, to handle in an efficient and appropriate manner, all the classified and protected information,\" Kessler wrote in a Thursday ruling. \"Moreover, a reasonable amount of delay and logistical burdens are a small price to pay for the virtues of judicial transparency.\" The government will likely appeal, meaning it's unlikely the videotapes will be released anytime soon. The case is Dhiab v. Bush (1:05-cv-1457). Summarize the above article in 3 sentences.", "answer": "Videos show forced feedings at Guantanamo Bay . They can only be released with modifications .

{"question": "Title: Vedic period Background: The Vedic period or Vedic age (c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE) is the period in the history of the Indian subcontinent intervening between the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization, and a second urbanisation which began in c. 600 BCE. It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. Section: Later Vedic period (c. 1100 - c. 500 BCE) Passage: After the 12th century BCE, as the Rigveda had taken its final form, the Vedic society transitioned from semi-nomadic life to settled agriculture. Vedic culture extended into the western Ganges Plain. Possession of horses remained an important priority of Vedic leaders and a remnant of the nomadic lifestyle, resulting in trade routes beyond the Hindu Kush to maintain this supply as horses needed for cavalry and sacrifice could not be bred in India. The Gangetic plains had remained out of bounds to the Vedic tribes because of thick forest cover. After 1000 BCE, the use of iron axes and ploughs became widespread and the jungles could be cleared with ease. This enabled the Vedic Aryans to settle at the western Gangetic plains. Many of the old tribes coalesced to form larger political units.  The Vedic religion was further developed when the Indo-Aryans migrated into the Ganges Plain after c. 1100 BCE and became settled farmers, further syncretising with the native cultures of northern India. In this period the varna system emerged, state Kulke and Rothermund, which in this stage of Indian history were a \"hierarchical order of estates which reflected a division of labor among various social classes\". The Vedic period estates were four: Brahmin priests and warrior nobility stood on top, free peasants and traders were the third, and slaves, labourers and artisans, many belonging to the indigenous people, were the fourth. This was a period where agriculture, metal, and commodity production, as well as trade, greatly expanded, and the Vedic era texts including the early Upanishads and many Sutras important to later Hindu culture were completed.  The Kuru Kingdom, the earliest Vedic \"state\", was formed by a \"super-tribe\" which joined several tribes in a new unit. To govern this state, Vedic hymns were collected and transcribed, and new rituals were developed, which formed the now orthodox Shrauta rituals. Two key figures in this process of the development of the Kuru state were the king Parikshit and his successor Janamejaya, transforming this realm into the dominant political and cultural power of northern Iron Age India.  The most well-known of the new religious sacrifices that arose in this period were the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice). This sacrifice involved setting a consecrated horse free to roam the kingdoms for a year. The horse was followed by a chosen band of warriors. The kingdoms and chiefdoms in which the horse wandered had to pay homage or prepare to battle the king to whom the horse belonged. This sacrifice put considerable pressure on inter-state relations in this era. This period saw also the beginning of the social stratification by the use of varna, the division of Vedic society in Kshatriya, Brahmins, Vaishya and Shudra.  The Kuru kingdom declined after its defeat by the non-Vedic Salva tribe, and the political centre of Vedic culture shifted east, into the Panchala kingdom on the Ganges. Later, the kingdom of Videha emerged as a political centre farther to the East, in what is today northern Bihar of India and south eastern Nepal, reaching its prominence under the king Janaka, whose court provided patronage for Brahmin sages and philosophers such as Yajnavalkya, Uddalaka Aruni, and Gargi Vachaknavi. CANNOTANSWER  Question: Was there migration in the later vedic period Answer: form, the Vedic society transitioned from semi-nomadic life to settled agriculture.

{"question": "Consider $x(t)$ to be given as, $$ x(t)=\\cos (1000 \\pi t) $$ . Let the sampling frequency be $2000 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. Does aliasing occur? Relevant Theorem: The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, also known as the Nyquist theorem or simply the sampling theorem, is a fundamental principle in the field of signal processing and digital communication. It provides a guideline for converting continuous-time (analog) signals into discrete-time (digital) signals by establishing a minimum sampling rate to accurately represent the original analog signal without losing any information.  The theorem states that a continuous-time signal can be accurately reconstructed from its discrete-time samples if the sampling rate (the number of samples taken per second) is at least twice the highest frequency component present in the original signal. This critical sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate, and the corresponding frequency is called the Nyquist frequency.  In mathematical terms, if a continuous-time signal x(t) has a highest frequency component B (measured in Hz), then the signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate fs (measured in samples per second) is greater than or equal to 2B:  fs ≥ 2B  If the sampling rate is lower than the Nyquist rate, a phenomenon called aliasing occurs, where higher frequency components in the original signal are misrepresented as lower frequency components in the sampled signal. This leads to distortion and loss of information, making it impossible to accurately reconstruct the original signal from the sampled data.  In summary, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is a fundamental principle in signal processing that dictates the minimum sampling rate required to accurately represent a continuous-time signal in discrete-time form without losing any information. By ensuring that the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency component in the original signal, the theorem guarantees that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples.", "answer": "False"}

Background: The prevalence and risk factors for infection with enteropathogens in dogs frequenting dog parks have been poorly documented, and infected dogs can pose a potential zoonotic risk for owners. Hypothesis/Objectives: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of infection with enteropathogens and zoonotic Giardia strains in dogs attending dog parks in Northern California and to compare results of fecal flotation procedures performed at a commercial and university parasitology laboratory. Animals: Three-hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in Northern California. Methods: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs, scored for consistency, and owners completed a questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation, DFA, and PCR for detection of 11 enteropathogens. Giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination. Results: Enteropathogens were detected in 114/300 dogs (38%), of which 62 (54%) did not have diarrhea. Frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency (P = .0039), but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection. Twenty-seven dogs (9%) were infected with Giardia, and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C and D. The frequency of Giardia detection on fecal flotation was significantly lower at the commercial laboratory versus the university laboratory (P = .013), and PCR for Giardia was negative in 11/27 dogs (41%) that were positive on fecal flotation or DFA. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Enteropathogens were commonly detected in dogs frequenting dog parks, and infection with Giardia correlated with fecal consistency. PCR detection of Giardia had limited diagnostic utility, and detection of Giardia cysts by microscopic technique can vary among laboratories.", "answer": "Prevalence of Enteropathogens in Dogs Attending 3 Regional Dog Parks in Northern California"}
